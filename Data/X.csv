1,"Adwords Support VentingI swear the worst part of Adwords is speaking to the phone support. They take almost every thing I say out of context. Since they aren't native english speakers theirs a lot of misunderstandings. What should be a 4 min conversations takes over an hour. They have the comprehension of a 3 yr old.  I wish I could record some of my conversations it's unbelievable how they talk to customers. Theirs probably AI more capable of doing there job.  I literally have to repeat everything dozens of times because they misunderstand almost everything I say. If Google didn't have a monopoly on search I would never use there service.

I have no problem with companies trying to save money but phone support in America should be with native english speakers only. Email support could be done with overseas support.

I know some people will have a problem with my post that's fine but I just have to let out some steam"

3,"How Do We Test Without Duplicating ContentHey All,

&amp;#x200B;

So this may be a bit tricky to explain but stick with me.  We're an IT consulting company, we're getting decent conversions on a a few of our ad groups, but there is one ad group that is not converting at all.  When I say converting I mean that we are getting click-throughs but no leads.   Other ad groups with lower CTR are getting better conversions with respect to lead generation.

&amp;#x200B;

My first thought (which could well be wrong) is the copy/content on the page.   I suspect that when people are searching for IT consultant and landing on a page that is geared towards consulting/strategy/outsourcing etc it is not what they intended and they are really looking for IT services (i.e. support, helpdesk, server management, etc).

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is that we already have an ad group and page optimised for IT services.  

&amp;#x200B;

My question is:  Do we optimise the content on the IT consulting page towards IT services, potentially duplicating content, or do we simply redirect the IT consulting ad group to the IT support/services landing page?  What is the best way to test this without impacting our current adwords campaigns and rankings?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance."

7,"PSA: Change for rules in new UI!I think this is happening, but I am not 100% sure - when you set a rule to pause campaigns, choosing all enabled campaigns, and then another rule to re-enable them, (common to pause campaigns for a holiday) the enable rule applies to ""all enabled campaigns"" AT THE TIME OF THE RULE FIRING - which at that point, is none!

9,"Clarification on match typesSetting up a campaign for a company that does air filtration for industrial businesses. I'm planning on doing a pure SKAGs with a keyword like \[commercial air filtration system\] as one of the exacts. My question is, how do I structure these types of keywords:

&amp;#x200B;

commercial air filter

commercial air filter system

commercial air filtration

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My assumption is that these would go into the BMM/Phrase match campaign. I'm looking for clarification on how to use the different match types for when the word ""system"" or ""filtration"" are used. In this example, +commercial +air +filter should cover it? Or would I also want to add +commercial +air +filtration? Or would +commercial +air in those two keywords be competing against each other?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if one exact match is \[commercial air filtration system\] is my assumption correct that \[industrial air filtration system\] should be another exact match ad group?

11,"Weird Question on ad impressions...Is it possible to show an ad to a user x times and decide that on the 3rd time eg if he does not engage with it that we either stop showing him the ad or we should him an alternate copy?

12,"Client wants to increase spend by 3x, but it is not feasible due to available search impressions.I have a client that has a weird product, it is fairly new and doesn't really have any competition. 

The issue is... the product is so unique there are only so many relevant keywords that I can go after. 

I have 3 campaigns that are hovering around 65% impression share. So I could increase the budget for these campaigns, but that would be far from increasing spend by 3x. 

I created a retargeting/similar audiences display campaign, but advised to them that converting at a reasonable cost wouldn't be feasible, and that this would be mostly for brand awareness.

Prior to the display campaign my cost per conversion was $5.00, now it is $47 (which is still their best cost per conversion across all their advertising platforms)

They wanted to continue to funnel money into the display, but I was clear that it wouldn't be a good idea and they wouldn't see the results they wanted. They also have a terrible conversion rate on their site sub 1%, which the display campaign attributed to that greatly as well as facebook. 

Anyone have experience with a client trying to increase spend when its not feasible? They could certainly increase it via facebook, they are already spending around 100k a month a few months ago they were around 240k a month. But the results are all over the place and now i'm worried they are over saturating their audience lists even though the frequency for the majority of them are sub 3.

Being small local businesses, real money comes in when plenty are acquired and optimization process is **automized** as much as it can so that it does not become chaotic and time consuming to manage so many different campaigns.

I think I am not wrong to say that the best way to go about it, is to **follow a planned out checklist**, generic for all clients or at least generic for each industry. The way I take action today is following new campaigns for 2/3 months and as they reach good performance I move on to the next new campaigns. But eventually they start to fluctuate (cant complain) since little follow up is done and important metrics are overlooked.

I suppose I can come up with a basic checklist myself and automize periodic supervisions so that there is containment in each campaign. But I am interested to know what are other advertisers take on this.

* *Is it an effective method?*
* *Is there already something similar to what I describe where I can rely on?*
* *What are your practices on following up on so many campaigns?*

Im thinking 2 checklists actually. One for long periods where things such as audiences and objectives are adjusted, and other one for the daily modifications such as new search terms to acquire, bid adjustments on keywords, etc.

I understand that personalized attention is also required. But I also believe 80% optimizations can be applied universally no matter the client, ad or campaign.

TLDR: I have little experience managing many campaigns. Is having a universal checklist of optimizations a good practice?

So my main store has made over $157K rev to date. Decent profit which I’m happy about. Without going into too much detail, I was wondering if any of y’all can help me with several tips.

It’s my main store as it has more of a brand presence and I actually bulk custom ordered a 2 of the 5 main products and shipped them out myself in order to save $, faster shipping, and add branding to the product. Furthermore, the other 3 are shipped within 9 days to a large majority of the countries I ship to

Do you guys have any tips on improvement or trial based on below:

* Retargeting (IG story only):  

   * 3 adsets for people who have: Viewed content, added to cart, or initiated checkout in the last 5 days.
   * All 3 adsets have their own unique but similar adcopy
   * All 3 adsets have over 6 ROAS with Initiate checkout (obviously) being highest at like 13 or 14
* Retargeting product that relates to whatever product I’m creating the said custom audience with (IG Story only):  

   * 3 adsets for people who have:  

      * Viewed content, added to cart, or initiated checkout in the last 20 days.
   * All 3 adsets have their own unique but similar adcopy
   * Just started this so the data isn’t like all the way there enough for me to say much
* Email/text marketing:  

   * Email sequences for people who abandon cart with decent recover rate
   * Waiting for a person that I follow to release his text sequences app so I can use that also.
   * Post purchase email sequences for post purchase purchase, working on fixing this though so I can get better results with this
* Cross/upselling:  

   * I currently have manual variants for certain products and each variant is a bogo starting at 1 for 25% off up to 5 for 50% off (I still make like a huge profit even with 50% off)

1. I know I need cross/upselling apps so if anyone has tips or ideas on which apps to checkout lmk.
2. In your LAA adsets, do you guys exclude other event LAAs (So let’s say you have a US 5-6% purchase LAA, you exclude all 30 (1-10%) other US LAAs for View Content, Add to Cart, and Initiate Checkout)? Or do you guys just exclude people who’ve seen the ad (3sec views) and/or viewed the product page? I’ve tried both and honestly can’t seem to really note any significant differrences.

56,"How do PPC teams split tasks and work effectively?I have a business partner with whom I provide Adwords and Facebook advertising services to small businesses, together with software development.

I used to run ads on my own and had the whole process really figured out. My partner had no part in this area. Soon he decided he wanted in and I was cool with it given the increase in the number of clients I was getting. In my head, this seemed a great choice since it would allow me to keep on taking clients without having to worry about having little structure/time to absorb new prospects.

The outcome however, was quite the opposite. We seem to differ at many points when planning out campaigns. I have much more experience but there still is resistance when sorting out key points. You know that phrase that says something like ""a camel is a horse sorted out by a committee"" or something like that? Well I believe it perfectly explains our current situation. It is becoming inefficient to agree on middlepoints which don't follow any specific plan precisely.

I do need help in order to keep on taking more clients but this does not seem to be the way. When we develop software, we split backend/frontend and everything flows more easily. But with PPC we are constantly debating on every new variable we are setting up to the campaign. I am getting annoyed and am pretty close to stating that these are clients I got, I am more experienced and he should backoff from important decisions, but it is difficult since we worked side by side in all previous projects. 

Also annoyed by the fact that I was generous (stupid) enough to cut him 50% since we are technically working side by side (though I am the one who has to face clients when the campaign performance does not quite work out), and really, I feel he is only helping me take longer to setup campaigns and not adding other type of value.

So going back to the title, how do they work effectively? Is debating everysingle thing as a group the way to go about? I believe not. How are tasks divided?

TLDR: I spend plenty of time debating with my associate, aspects of our client's campaigns. It is inefficient. How can we efficiently work as a team?"

58,"Thoughts on Ad Copy version history?So I was looking at this new feature after modifying an existing ad because I noticed my new ad received 53 impressions within 5 minutes of being created. At first i thought this was an AdWords glitch but then also noticed the original ad wasnt showing as deleted, instead it can be viewed under version history where the metrics are attributed correctly.

Of course, I would never exclude it if the product would be relevant to marketers.

60,"Where do YOU turn when diagnosing/fixing low conversions?When you're running a campaign that just isn't working, what is your first port of call when it comes to fixing low conversions?

Normally I feel confident on running campaigns (primarily Google Ads &amp; Facebook Ads) to get conversions in quite a range of industries, business types etc.

But I've got this one campaign at the moment that is doing my head in.

We are going for demo requests (not normal free trials but specifically arranged demonstration with a sales rep) for an industry-focused, B2B SaaS.

There's a specific landing page set up - benefits + leave your details, fairly basic stuff - and a few different ad campaigns driving traffic from both Google &amp; Facebook.

Most of the traffic is coming from remarketing audience clicks from people who have visited the site in the past 30 days but not requested a demo. 

Remaining 35% of traffic is a combination of similar audience + location &amp; interest overlays; so should be rather targeted.

We've had over 1500 hits to the landing page but only a handful of conversions.

Everyone who hits the landing page is added to another remarketing audience and followed up again with an FB lead ad + ads on Google Display with strong call-to-action.

Traffic metrics are decent in GA ... even the ""cold"" traffic isn't too far off the day-to-day traffic the site receives in terms of bounce rate, time on site etc.

61,"Rebuilding Quality Scores from the ground upBEFORE YOU SAY IT: I understand the core contributors to improving your QS. But in this situation, we're looking at quality scores in the dumps -- 1s and 2s. This means that even with putting a bunch of improvements in place (better ad copy, more relevance of ads, stronger landing pages) the ads are rarely displaying, due to poor QS. So with no data to go off, how can we expect Google to see we're doing better and bump up our QS?   


Are we just stuck in the dumps? 1 Quality Score -&gt; No ads displaying -&gt; no way to improve QS.

73,"Thoughts on paid advertising with Capterra for B2B?We're a small B2B SaaS startup with a 12 month old product. A couple of months ago we listed in several relevant categories on [Capterra](https://www.capterra.com/) and I worked to seed 7 reviews from users. We're now at the top of a couple of the niche categories but then way down the page for the more competitive categories. Capterra do not include a link to your website on the free listing, however, if you do PPC they do. The catch is you have to do PPC in all categories you list in – even the highly competitive ones.

Has anyone had experience with Capterra PPC? How did it compare to other PPC offerings like Google / Facebook? It seems like a good place to appeal to business software purchasers and approvers."

​

Think about it: 0,03$ = 0,0258€ at current exchange rate, but since Facebook represents just 2 digits of the decimal part, it would approximate the value to 0,03€, and this thing just propagates much more with higher amounts of money.

I submitted my claim form anyway in October and the claims administrator took it and said if there was anything left over afterwards that they would pay me, and wait six months. 

They've been basically giving me the runaroind since then and now say if there's anything  left I'll get an Adwords credit (they never mentioned a credit before). And I don't use Adwords anymore, I want money.

82,"Anyone seen Google Ads conversions screech to a halt after increasing your daily budget?This is baffling to me.

Through June and July, we were seeing about 2 - 3 conversions per week through Google Ads, which is pretty good for our low volume, high-value ecommerce store. Near the beginning of August, we decided to put a little more money into the two campaigns that were producing conversions but marked as limited by budget, one Shopping campaign and one Search campaign, so we increased the daily budget on both of them. We have not had a single conversion since making that change.

Here are some notes:

* Conversions in this case refers to sales.
* The only other change we made around the time conversions stopped was to add a few exact match negative keywords for things unrelated to our products. We had been doing this regularly for the previous few months.
* Impressions and clicks did not increase or decrease significantly.
* We only changed the daily budget for the campaigns. We did not change our bids.
* Our pricing is still competitive, so I don't think this is an issue with comparison shopping any more than it would have been when our ads were converting.
* Organic traffic and conversions for August were as good if not a bit better than they were in June and July.
* When I was digging through my Google Ads account the other day, the graph for one of my ad groups showed a conversion for this past Sunday. There was no conversion value associated with it, and the table below the graph reported zero conversions. Today, the graph no longer shows that conversion.
* The order confirmation page I use for conversion tracking has not changed.
* Google Ads is seeing the conversion tracking tag on my website, but says the last conversion it recorded was on August 15. Nowhere else does Google Ads report a conversion for August 15, and I cannot find any evidence of a PPC conversion for that date in any of the analytics tools I use. As best as I can tell, the last PPC conversion was August 4.
* Ads are showing at roughly the same times of day as they were before. Shopping ads are blowing through the daily budget before noon every day, even though the delivery method is set to standard, but that was the case in June and July as well.

The most viable hypothesis I've been able to come up with so far is that our Google Ads account is haunted. Anyone have any ideas?"

​

From an old post here, none of these seem to be the issue:

Your website could be loading so slow analytics isn't loading before people bounce. (has a 1.9s load time)

You could have some sort of redirect on the page causing it to lose attribution during the redirect. (no redirects)

You could have people clicking on extensions that don't lead people to the website (e.g. call extension) and so a session is never recorded. (they don't have extensions setup on their adwords account)

You may be doing some weird stuff with frames on the site which is causing attribution to be lost and credited to direct traffic. (don't believe this to be the case)

Pushing promotions through Headline Text Ad Copy vs Sitelinks  
One of our agencies said this, what do you guys think?

* Pushing promotions through Headline Text Ad Copy vs Sitelinks - There is a trade off:  

   * **Headline** \- Copy is more visible and directly correlative to the intended experience. To run effectively, need to pause out Evergreen ads. This can hurt Quality Score and Increase CPC's - the trade off is if performance makes up more the upfront deficit. Setup requires more diligence with rotating in, scheduling the pausing/enabling of evergreen/promotion ads.  

   * **Sitelink** \- Practically the inverse option. Copy is less visible and potentially not going to show (since Google determines which Extensions show). Does not effect costs and setup is easier. Less likely to drive incremental performance.

We're getting mixed results so far using Universal App Campaigns (UAC) - our campaigns are showing 200 installs per day, but we haven't seen an uptick in total Android downloads in the Playstore console.  The fear is that many of our PPC installs might simply be cannibalized from our organic Playstore traffic.  

From the adwords metrics side, \~77% of our conversions are coming from the Google search network, which includes Playstore ads.  I spent some time on the phone yesterday with Adwords support - unfortunately they were flat out wrong with some of the things they told me, and had to backtrack when i pointed it out, so I'm looking for additional advice.  Having done some research, I understand that cannibalization isn't a new concern in PPC.  I just haven't seen anyone break it down for mobile app marketing and the Playstore in particular.  

So a couple of questions:

1. Is there any way to a) restrict UAC ads from showing in the playstore? I'm guessing no, since UAC settings are so minimal.
2. Is there any way to at least measure what proportion of your clicks/conversions can be attributed to the playstore vs other parts of the Google Search network?  This seems like it would be a fundamental need in doing ROI calcs.
3. Any other advice?

(75% of all conversions come from here, whilst using 10% of the budget) There's not much competition on those keywords - should I pause those branded keywords since i'm paying for 'free' traffic anyways? (they are 1,2 and 3 in the organic results)

The complaint from my client is that if he removes the branded campaigns (which he sees as paying for traffic that would come for free anyhow) the CPA isn't that great. Not sure how to approach this.

​

I'm trying to setup FB ads for a client however I am running into some issues. I've posted a question on the official FB forum but that was back on Monday and still no response (I don't think they have a direct phone number either). Anyway here's the question:

​

[https://www.facebook.com/business/help/community/question/?id=10156410696160428&amp;rdrhc](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/community/question/?id=10156410696160428&amp;rdrhc)

​

The question is self explanatory - I have been granted access to a page - and when I go to [facebook.com/ads](https://facebook.com/ads) I can create an ad for that page with a custom audience - however I would really prefer to do it in Facebook Business Manager - my understanding is that this is much more professional - however I have no idea how everything works.

I have been granted access to a FB page - and I can create the ad from my page as you can see:

[http://prntscr.com/ko4fyb](http://prntscr.com/ko4fyb)

However when I go into Facebook Business Manager I don't know how to create the ad:

[http://prntscr.com/ko4gm6](http://prntscr.com/ko4gm6)

​

IN the screenshot above you can see that it has a bunch of accounts - but if i've been granted access to a page what I want to do is:

1. Have the client enter in their credit card details so the ads are charged on their behalf
2. get access to the audience of the Facebook Page that I have been granted to! (from FB Business Manager)

I feel like I'm going around in circles here but anyone that is in the know - your help would be much appreciated.

Thanks!"
113,"Potential client doesn't want to pay for our services because they're a charity and it's a Google Grant. Client does $6M / year in donations and has 20 full-time staff. Share your cheapskate client stories!Anyone else have a cheapskate client story to share?  
My business partner just turned down an embarrassing offer from a charity that wants to be our client.  
When my partner does sales on her own, I mentor her and only get involved once it's time to hammer out a contract.  This time, the client low-balled us, requesting a $200 per month management fee.  It was a great learning experience for her because she didn't want to say ""No.""  Although I would have been SO proud if she countered with a fair offer right away, or even turned them down, she told them that she has to discuss it with her business partner.  
Obviously, $200 doesn't even cover the cost of the time my partner and I spend discussing and reporting on the account.  Even more, a Google grants account is more difficult to manage because of the requirements to stay active. E.g. the account must stay above 5% CTR and CPC is capped at $2, among other requirements.  
She and I spoke at length about the disadvantages of discounting our work.  I explained to her that we would be forgoing future work from a well-paying client, because of our commitment to this charity; we would be choosing to work for someone that doesn't value our contribution. etc.    
So, we countered their offer with a very fair management fee which they declined, as predicted.  Their excuse is that it's too expensive for their budget.  The potential client told us that their previous PPC manager was a grad student who was doing it ""for experience"" up until the account was suspended for not meeting standards.  
Well, I did some digging on the charity and they have 20 full-time staff at their national office and do more than $6 million per year in donations.  
So many red-flags."

The bot will ask 3-4 questions and then show reader a list of products based on his answers. The bot is triggered by user requesting help.

You can't really chat with the bot (it's dumb). All it does it ask simple questions and give you 2-5 buttons to select. Anyone with any experience with internet will be able to tell it is a bot. But it looks nice, and has author's picture. We can also make it do friendly things like say hello.

Internally we're wondering:

1. Are there studies out there that talks about whether landing pages convert better when the Chat Bot uses a human picture and also never explicitly say ""I'm a robot""?
2. If we do want to disclose, but still keep the picture of the human as the ""face"" of the bot, how do we say it? Do we say ""Hi, I'm a bot built upon the knowledge of Peter Smith?"" Like how do you say that?

My coworker and I were discussing this and it got me thinking; now I just want to know for sure what the best strategy going forward since the single Shopping campaign I've been overseeing has been in the toilet since day 1.

&amp;#x200B;

It's always been my understanding that the description for each shopping product is supposed to be as full as possible without being media-rich and too format-rich. So, good grammar, good usability, good design, essentially copy and paste the description from the landing page. Google even states this verbatim in the help manual. I thought that the title and the description are parsed for keywords, but the title is weighed more heavily.

&amp;#x200B;

My coworker disagrees, and for relatively good reason: he's stating that it's better to list keywords and key phrases separated with commas as the description. I immediately disagreed, until I saw that he'd previously done this for a Shopping campaign, albeit still including the full description afterwards, with pretty good success—the info he was putting in the description couldn't be found on the landing page despite being crucial for ensuring compatibility, so it at least put the product on the SERP. My coworker still thinks that the full description shouldn't be included, just the keywords.

I also can’t run them side by side because they’re too similar and it would be odd if they showed up together.

1. I started using Target ROAS and after about 2 weeks it was performing BEAUTIFULLY. 
2. It started by spending only about half of our allotted daily budget, but after 3.5 weeks was spending the whole budget plus a few dollars. Still maintained excellent ROAS.
3. In the last 5 days, however, the campaign has been spending 2x the budget \*every single day\*.
4. Problem? The ROAS has dropped off from 900%+ to closer to 300-400% which is terrible for us. 

I keep telling myself to just let the campaign continue to run and the algorithm will work it out, but these numbers suck and it feels like we're just throwing money away now. The Target ROAS strategy was working beautifully.... why the sudden drastic change &amp; what can we do about it?

176,"Can anyone get Facebook Ads Manager to work on iOS?Background: After destroying my MacBook with a well-timed cup of coffee, I ended up buying an iPad instead of another laptop. I constantly travel, so the new iPad Pro seemed like a better option. A friend told me about a friend of his running a marketing agency off of one, and I saw a few similar stories online, so I thought it was probably a safe move. I thought about testing Ads Manager in the Apple Store, but decided I didn’t want to input my Facebook password onto a semi-public computer.

Maybe this was a huge mistake, because now I can’t seem to get the Ad Manager to work. The page loads, but when I try to scroll within the central management area with all the content in, I’m only able to scroll the entire page. That central areas stays fixed on what it showed me initially. Trying to click and drag the scroll bar is similarly unhelpful. I’ve tried four different browsers (plus my phone) now, and the problem persists across all of them.

Facebook has an “Ads Manager app” which I downloaded and tried, but it’s horrendous: very low resolution, no landscape mode (wtf?), doesn’t seem to be full-featured, etc.

I’ve tried Googling this issue, but can’t really find much. Finding anything related to Facebook is always a nightmare because there’s so much random irrelevant content that comes up. I just wrote to their tech support.

So, has anyone actually been able to make the thing work or find a way to manage ads on iOS?

190,"Question About AnalyticsI run ads for my company, and our backend (woocommerce reports) says we get, say, 20 sales last weekend, but 3 are clearly attributed to ads. My boss wants to know what the ads are doing, so I try to explain it to him. He's a visual learner, though, so I show him the FB Ads Manager &amp; Google Analytics.  


Backend says we made $100ish from those 3 sales. Backend says we made like $500 from all 20 sales. Facebook says we made 8 sales, for $800. Google analytics says we made 1 sale for $10. I have already reinstalled Facebook pixels several times, made sure it wasn't in any header/snippet plugins. I know some company before me tried ""integrating"" the two, so putting pixel on google tag manager, and the custom conversions I have set up, I set the values to $0.

From my understanding, the inconsistency in the reporting is due to the attribution window, and how they attribute clicks. But ... $10 vs $100 vs $800. That's kind of a big difference.

199,"I don't think Fuelx is legit - here's whyNot sure if r/PPC is the best place to post this since it's technically not PPC, but it is performance based, which I think this is the best place for that theme.  Some background on me - I'm a part owner of a midsize performance digital marketing agency who typically runs a mix of Google Ads, FB/IG, and native to scale companies profitably.

We've come across several instances over the past few months of new clients that we inherited their accounts where they have been running direct on Fuelx.  The client feedback is almost unanimously ""this seems too good to be true, and we're not sure about the incrementality here, but we don't have any proof to say otherwise"".

I don't have proof either, but here are some themes that I've identified consistently across clients that run Fuelx, and I'm curious if others have experience with them and have seen the same:

* GA reported Conversion Rate is the highest of any channel - 7% on video remarketing &amp; 6% on video prospecting vs. email at 4% vs. FB remarketing at 2% (their revenue &amp; traffic split is nearly 50/50 remarketing/prospecting)
* GA reported % new visits on remarketing campaigns is \~40%.  Remarketing should be closer to 5% new (assuming some missing data from cookie clearing, ad blockers, cross device, etc.)
* GA conversion paths reporting - this one is pretty damning.  Nearly 70% of all revenue for Fuelx is reported as 1 touch.   How could that be happening if 50% of the revenue is attributed to remarketing?  Also going back to that conversion rate - how in the hell could video prospecting ads drive an abnormally high conversion rate and be the only touch point?

All of this points to some form of cookie stuffing - similar to what Steelhouse was accused of in the Criteo vs. Steelhouse lawsuit a few years back.  Basically Fuelx is most likely engineering their platform to create a new cookie &amp; visitor session and somehow intersecting the user just before conversion to grab conversions from other channels.

This post  from a few months ago lends more credence my assumption: [https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/8lge2x/anyone\_use\_fuelx/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/8lge2x/anyone_use_fuelx/)

This is difficult to prove right now since these clients are not running through an adserver like DoubleClick, so there is a lack of central source of truth other than GA, which isn't that robust.  

Have others worked with Fuelx and drawn similar conclusions?  This is very worrying because some of our clients have been steered in the wrong direction prior to us coming on board."

201,"Tracking Conversions In FacebookSince the 11th I've received a lot of conversions and it's only after I started my FB ads.

If it ever does decide to work I don't see anywhere you can find out which campaign, which countries made the conversions.

Now after I added and tested to make sure my pixel was there my sales dropped over 90% since re adding the pixel.

209,"Is it OK to use ""offline"" conversion import for online conversions instead of using conversion tag (or global tag)?I have a project which is a lead gen combined with some backend activity further down the road.


Very top of the funnel. So initial signup doesn't take much consideration/convincing. Most people convert on the first click withing minutes. So conversion window is short. No repeat visits to convert. Usually done on the same device in the same browsing session.


But.


I won't know about the quality of a lead until much later in the process. Process similar to multiple repeated sales on the back end. Maybe a month later, maybe more. Maybe once, maybe multiple times.


So...


Browsers are increasingly getting more and more cookie-averse. Google keeps mentioning how we need to combine GCLID with Analytics global tag to use first-party cookies instead of using their third-party cookies for conversion tracking. They are now using cross-device conversions and statistical methods to recover lost conversions (or invent those that never happened), and so on. We can no longer out out of it.


In any case, cookies don't live very long anymore. And plenty of users sign up on one device and follow-up on another. Then switch back to the first device and so on.


So I'm thinking about enabling auto-tagging, collecting GCLID on my end, and switching to ""offline"" conversion import. Either by scheduling scripting or by using AdWords API to make the process automatic.


The way my business is set up, I can account for maybe 95%+ of conversions by simply tying the initial click's GCLID with user data I maintain on my end all through the entire relationship with this lead/customer/user. And all future actions/sales/conversions of this user.


Initially, I thought about using offline conversion import just for the backend actions. But then I thought, why not unify and simply switch to using offline/imported conversions for everything. Even for the initial signup conversion.


So I would have no event tags (global tag, etc.) firing at all. Instead, I would maintain GCLID on my end. And then import it when the conversion happens.


Is there some downside I'm missing? Something obvious?


Assuming that maintaining GCLID on my end is not a technical challenge, is there something else I need to consider before moving to using ""offline"" conversions for tracking ""online"" conversions?

As context, the client is running ads with the purpose of recruiting participants for a research project. So, registering as a participant and doing some pre-qualifying activities is our ""conversion"". The research begins in November - so I potentially have 2 months to advertise. 

Would really appreciate any guidance on this!!"

If instead we kept adding the prev 2 weeks STR to a master search term report, apply conditional formatting to highlight duplicates, then filter for only non-coloured cells, we should have only terms that arrived in the last 2 weeks that we’ve never seen, right?

230,"How would you structure Amazon PPC campaigns for my business?Hi everyone.

I'm looking for some advice on how to structure my Amazon PPC campaigns. I'd be grateful if someone could help or direct me to someone to advise me.

I have around 15 products - most of which have colour variations.

Here's my website - [Beddoes Products](https://beddoesproducts.com/)

There is very low search volume for the longtail keywords related to each product. For example, my product Roof Tile Vent To Fit Marley Ludlow Major Roof Tiles"" - the keyword ""marley ludlow major roof tile vent"" has very few searches but I do still want to show up when that term is used.

Most people would only search ""roof tile vent"" or ""roof ventilation tile"" without the brand and tile profile.

So my question is, should I: 

A) Create 1 campaign and select all of my products and use the more generic keywords ""roof tile vent"", ""roof ventilation tiles"", ""vented roof tiles"" and then separate campaigns for each product with more specific keywords like ""marley ludlow major roof tile vent""?

B) Create separate campaigns for each product and add both keywords - ""roof tile vent"" and ""marley ludlow major roof tile vent"" to each product campaign?

So I could have 1 product called ""Roof Tile Vent To Fit Redland 49"" using ""roof tile vents"" and ""redland 49 roof tile vent"" as keywords.

And another product called ""Roof Tile Vent To Fit Marley Modern"" using ""roof tile vents"" and ""marley modern roof tile vents"".

How would you go about it?

Thank you if you took the time to read this.

234,"Smart Shopping questions compared to dynamic remarketingHey, my last call with our adwords rep was very focused on pushing us to try smart shopping campaign. They basically told us that it has much better results than our standard shopping campaign. 

We have activated it, but its still way too early to tell but I do have some questions:

1. it seems to be eating up the budget that you give it, whereas our normal shopping campaign never came close ($500 a day usually only hit $100-150) is this normal for smart shopping campaigns?
2. I am not sure I fully understand the features of the smart shopping campaign yet. It sounds like a regular shopping campaign with the following: Conversion optimizer for higher ROI, Much more automated (can't even see/block keywords or what specific cpcs are), and has dynamic remarketing basically built in..
3. What exactly is the difference here compared to dynamic remarketing? It seems to be the exact same thing except lumped into one campaign. Is that wrong?

I am not opposed to letting google algorithms do their thing, I know many here will often say that they do not perform as well as manually optimized campaign and losing data is never a good thing. But I am willing to at least give it a shot, if it performs better than our regular shopping I'm all for it. Just looking to see if I understand it correctly.

246,"Shopping Campaign Funnel Strategy FailureI recently worked with our SEM team to implement a shopping campaign structure inspired by the query level bidding strategy I guess was started by Martin Roettgerding for one of our verticals.

Our business strategy is such that we really only want to be drawing traffic from ""SKU Specific"" search queries.  Although I saw some indication it might not work, including from this forum, I wanted to try setting the bids in my funnel or sieve campaign at $0.01 and see the results myself. 

How its Structured:

\- Products Separated at the Ad Group Level

\- Budget Shared

Campaign 1 - The Funnel

\- High Priority

\- Enhanced CPC Bid: $0.01

\- Negative Keywords: All SKU's

Campaign 2 - SKU Specific

\- Medium Priority

\- Enhanced CPC Bid (Varies, based on historical data wherever possible)

\- Negative Keywords: Our Standard List

The result so far is that we have not had one single impression. This is NOT the result I expected. Bear in mind I am knew to AdWords relatively speaking so maybe I am missing something because from what I can tell all the products are eligible. 

I understand there is a bidding threshold, but even if the first campaign couldn't meet it the second absolutely should have. So I appeal to those more knowledgeable than I because as far as I can tell either the bids are ALL too low in Campaign 2 (unlikely) or not meeting the bid threshold on Campaign 1 is preventing Campaign 2 from Bidding (which again makes no sense to me given the negative keywords and how priority supposedly works). I must be missing something here."

254,"How To Price Paid Traffic?**Hi everyone!**

I'm just taking a course on digital marketing and there is a part that explains ""How to price paid traffic"" I'm gonna try to explain what this module says and then ask you, experienced marketers for clarification.

The course says that you need to first find (or get from the business owner) yearly value of the customer.

times

How many costumes you think you can bring them every month.

equals

your value divided 2.

equals

your service fee +ad spend 

That way you are giving them 2x ROI

**Example**

Dental Practice:

If the average patient schedules 2 appointments a year for hygiene and exams at $400/each, and then a major case every three years costing around $2500, then we can figure that your patient's lifetime value is $1,633 per year. This was calculated by taking the $400 and doubling it for the exams  and then dividing $2500 by 3 to get the yearly amount

Yearly customer Value: $1,633

The conversion formula:

10 leads = 5 Appointments 

5 Appointments = 1 customers 

10 leads = 1 customers = $1,633 a year for the dental practice

If I bring them 10 leads and they can get 5 Appointments (for whatever promotion offer that I have done on FB) 

and then they manage to convert 1 costumer from those 5 appointments, the value that they get per year is $1,633.

The course then says that if you bring them 4 costumes (40 leads) you bring the business value of $6,532 and therefore you can charge for this service up to $3,266 monthly ($2000 service fee + $1000 ad spend) and you still get them 2x ROI.

**My problem with this**

Now the problem that I have with this is, that the dental practice makes a profit of $6,532 but that's not a net profit, net profit might be 30% (and I think I'm being really generous here) that means that they actually make only $ 1,959. In this case, they would be actually losing money by paying an agency $3k a month.

I'm really struggling to understand how to set up your prices and still get the business ROI, especially for someone like restaurants where their net income is around 5%-15%.

 after all, that's the reason for offering this service, you want them to make money, but you also want to make money your self.

I hope that this question makes sense, and I really appreciate your help."

There is not a strict URL structure to the landing pages provided by this App.  Meaning that Campaign 1, targeting niche 1 may have conversions on multiple different pages from app.com.  Campaign 2, targeting niche 2, will also trigger ""leads"" on different app.com/random-pages. 

This means that I ***can't*** create a custom conversion for these ""leads"" where I set **url contains '/campaign-1'** to distinguish Campaign 1's leads from Campaign 2s leads.

I come come from SEO and I have a question about Adwords.

**The case:**

We want to be really aggressive about our Black Friday campaign this year. We are going to 302 redirect most of our pages which have Adwords ads to our Black Friday campaign page, which is on the same domain.

[example.com/shoes/](https://example.com/shoes/) 302 redirect to [example.com/black-friday/](https://example.com/black-friday/)

**The question:**

Can we somehow exclude Google Ads Bot from these changes?

I know that if the ads have redirecting URLs they are going to be stopped and our Adwords account can be banned.

So we were advised to check our server logs and to see how Google Ads Bot is crawling our website, but there is no trace of Google Ads Bot yet.

The goal of checking the server logs is to have some sort of parameter that will help us exclude Google Ads Bot from the redirects. What I mean is when this bot enters the site it woud not be redirected and it will see only the 200 OK link.

Have someone tried this kind of aggressive promotion with Adwords ads running and what were the results?

I don't link AdWords to Analytics (integration is not enabled). I do use GTAG. The tag was generated by my Analytics account and then I added AdWords account to it, but never linked AdWords and Analytics. I have been using it for many months now since I switched from the old conversion tracking tags, and it works fine. AdWords conversion tracking works as expected.

I have my reasons not to link AdWords and Analytics. So all the times Google reps have been trying to get me to enable auto-tagging and enable Analytics integration, I've been ignoring them.

I still don't want to link AdWords and Analytics, but in light of cookie handing/privacy issues (and it's only going to get worse), I would like to utilize gclid parameter to help AdWords tracking.

\*So the question is:\* Would enabling auto-tagging but without linking Analytics, with gtag (for both Analytics accounts and AdWords accounts through respective gtag 'config') allow AdWords to utilize gclid to track conversions when browsers restrict cookies?

If I understand it correctly, when gclid parameter is present, Analytics code executed on the page makes a note of it, and uses first-party cookie (since it's executed on my page) to make the tracking stick in cases when third-party cookie would get discarded.

Does that only work if I link AdWords and Analytics? Or would it work for unlinked accounts too?

I don't want/need Analytics reports for paid traffic in the context of this discussion. I'm only interested in making sure AdWords is utilizing gclid parameter and Analytic's code to improve AdWords tracking."

It's been a long time coming, since the introduction of ""Smart Display"" campaigns, to be honest. That was when I first really uncovered how low-quality GDN can be. WordPress blogs set up to exploit placement finder. Tons of kid channels on YouTube. If you aren't defining the placement or remarking, I've found quality traffic for B2B companies to be incredibly hard to find.

SO, I'm looking for an alternative! Can anyone recommend a display network that offers easy targeting and high-quality placements?"
274,"B2B Adwords: how to avoid clicks from consumers?Hello all,

We are a manufacturer and wholesaler (B2B) of industrial clamping products such as hose clamps and so-called P-clips. We are a relatively small player in the market but have a steady flow of new customers coming from search engine advertising.

However, we also have a steady flow of consumers clicking on our ads and then inquiring for 1 or 10 clamps. This is obviously not the audience we are targeting. It is however understandable since hose clamps and p-clips are widely used in and around people's houses and gardens.

Our target audience are B2B purchasers and engineers who are either in the process of sourcing clamps or incorporating them into 3D drawings. To bring down the amount of clicks from consumers we lowered the mobile phone / tablet bids by 80%, since our feeling is that the purchasers in our market don't really use these devices in their jobs. Consumers, on the other hand are more likely to use them. We also try to use B2B-related language in our advertisments such as ""for OEMs and wholesalers"" or ""large quantities"".

My question to you is whether you have any further tips for getting rid of unwanted consumer clicks when targeting a B2B audience. Any input is greatly appreciated!"

281,"Google Ads campaign self destructed after forced change to new ad platform. HELP!Hi there, I will try to keep this simple, but i am just super frustrated and am not getting any help from google. I keep calling but i get people in a call center with thick accents i cant understand that seem to just read off a script and answer no questions. When i asked to be transferred to a US google rep, they said they cannot do it. Anyway, now I am here.

I have automated rules that keep my bids around what the estimated top of page bid is. I have my max CPC set in the campaign settings at $3.00. For the past year, my words would always be between 50 cents and $3.00, very rarely exceeding $3.00, but when it did, it wouldn't run because of the max CPC setting i had.

last month i got a notification that my automated rules arent working anymore. I went to edit them, but i was only able to edit them on the new platform. Fine, i figured it out and got the rules going again. Now the weirdest thing, words i have been paying a dollar or two for the past year are suddenly costing me $10.00+. Weird, it sucks, but not a big deal since my max cpc at the campaign level set at $3.00 should stop that word from running. Wrong, i got wacked $11.00 for a click that ive paid a dollar or two hundreds of times on. I double checked, and right in the settings it still says Max cpc $3.00. I do not understand!

Anyway, my main questions are: What is the proper way to keep my bids at top of page bid estimates? How do i stop the word from running if the top of page bid exceeds the amount i am willing to pay? Why would a word that has cost a dollar or two for over a year suddenly jump to over $10.00?

* I have a Shopify Pet Store, no previous traffic or customers. 
* I have Facebook Pixel and Analytics
* I try targeting audiences like ""dogs"" or other companies like ""petsmart"" and audiences that likes ""dogs"" &amp; ""petsmart"" but hardly got any traffic. My budget is about $10 daily and ran it for about a week before I turn it off.
* I am using 3 video ads of a 30 second video that displays the product.
* When I run a conversion campaign I hardly get any traffic, If I run an Engagement campaign I do get engagement to the same audiences.
* I setup the conversion to ""Purchased"" and later read someone that since I didn't have any previous conversions I should lower it to ""Add to Cart""
* Since the traffic has been so low I haven't setup my retargetting campaign.

Maybe people are not buying because it's cold traffic, my product is well priced.

Some of the strategies I thought was to setup an awareness campaign using my daily content and show my ad only to people who have watched 75% of my videos, likes, shared my other posts or read a blog post. And show my retargetting to people that visited my product page and not just my home page.

We have account managers that hold the relationship with the clients hosting regular con-calls to discuss performance. We are supposed to be equals but they tend to ask us to do a lot of different things that I feel should be their jobs, mainly on the reporting end.

Media specialists will:

1. manage &amp; build campaigns - budgets, bids, a/b testing and all else campaign optimization related.
2. Campaign performance reporting to account managers including building out excel, pdf or powerpoint reports.
3. Logging all performance changes for account managers to report to clients. i.e conversions increased by X MOM and Y YOY. We are seeing heavy competition in the market place from X, Y and Z etc....
4. Provide ideas based around A/B testing for landing pages or ad copy or new strategies for clients to try.

Account managers will:

1. Hold weekly, biweekly or monthly calls with clients.
2. Report performance to clients verbally usually based on notes provided by campaign specialists.
3. Try to upsell services.
4. Tell clients yes we can/will without consulting campaign strategists for possible alternatives. i.e. We want to split campaign into 6 regions but have no additional budget.

I come from a small town in a small country (35.000 with surrdounding areas, 2 million country) and although I'm a beginner in digital marketing, I already see great potential in this business.

Many small businesses still use only traditional marketing channels, mostly radio, some bilboards, etc. My idea was to listen to the radio commercials, see which businesses use it for advertising, check their digital marketing efforts and offer to help them.

I just checked one business for example. They have several retails stores and they advertise though radio. Their Facebook page has 25 likes and no ads running. They don't do Google Adwords, they don't even have Google My Business set up.

I was thinking that I could pitch them by presenting how many people I could reach for the amount they currently spend on radio ads (I know the prices). I could reach more than twice as many people with less money. I was thinking of offering Facebook Ad campaigns and Google search/display campaigns, with the goal to drive traffic to the stores and website as they do not offer online orders.

Does GDN have similar strategies? Or how else would you do it, even if it involves more manual work? Should I try and handpick the websites where I want my ads to show up and remove all else?

300,"Tracking multiply different ID button clicks on a page with facebook pixelHi!

Im running a **facebook ad campaign** and i have a **landing page** created with a second page that contains only buttons/links to take the visitor to the partners pages where they can purchase the product.

i have been searching for solution for quite long to figure it out how is it possible to track button clicks on a page that i created. I know how can i track one button for example a CTA button on a landing page.

**My scenario is:**

I have a Landing page where i show a product and at the bottom of the page there is a CTA button what takes you to a **second page** where i have **12 buttons** (with unique ID-s like buttonID01, buttonID02, buttonID03 ... etc.).

So my goal would be to see how many times did they click on my **button 01** which took them to my partners page and how many times did they click on the **second button and so on.** So i can have a clear picture how many times the buttons have been clicked so that means they went to my partners shopping page.

I have been checking out Facebook developers documentation on the to  **Track In-Page Events** especially for buttons.

Here is how they say it can be done (ofc. it can be done in many other ways):

     &lt;button onClick=""fbq('track', 'Purchase');""&gt;Button Text&lt;/button&gt; 

or  you could create a function that pushes the event. 

    &lt;script&gt;
    function onClick() {
    fbq('track', 'Purchase');
    };
    &lt;/script&gt;

These are great for one button but how can i track more different button clicks separately.

**So in facebook ad manager i can see if they clicked on the first button 12 times on the second button 20 times and so on.**

I would really appriciate the help because i have been trying for days many things without any success.

They only tell me that I am getting impressions and clicks but no conversions and that I should wait till the Google learn how to optimize my traffic. 

Points that i have already covered:

\-Negative keywords are added regularly to campaigns ( all one word or two words search terms are added as exact match negatives to weed out searches of top of the funnel)

\-Almost 60% of Feed  titles are optimized ( 400 products in total)

\-Product groups are divided by product type

\- I kept changing bidding on product level and campaign level but that did not make a difference

\-I had my campaigns set up to enhanced cpc bidding but google rep asked me to turn it off because I only had 13 conversions in the past 30 days so I did. I am on manual bidding now

\- I turned on smart goals in GA and imported it into AW ( around the time that conversions stopped)

I know that my budget is really small and I do not have the money to invest into a professional service to run my campaigns. I hired someone from upwork but it turned out to be a complete disaster so I started managing it on my own.

Option 1)  

Audience: Show ads to people likely to be interested in these keywords and also on web pages, apps and videos related to these keywords (recommended)  
  


&amp;nbsp;


Option 2)  

Content: Only show ads on web pages, apps and videos related to these keywords

Google docu says:  


”  

This setting lets you decide how keywords in this ad group will be used to target ads.
Audience targeting lets you target ads to people based on their interests or the sites they visit. AdWords may use data from your Audience sources to improve the bidding and targeting of your audience campaigns.
Content targeting shows ads on content (web pages, apps and videos) directly related to your keywords. This option may significantly narrow your reach. (warning sign: Your ads may reach significantly fewer people if you choose this option)

He thinks the current setup is ""finished"" (fair to say: last 3 months have not shown significant improvements in KPIs).  

I don't want to ditch this client and convince him that continuing the work is the better option for him.

Here's my list of arguments, please add yours if you have some:  
  
* Google is constantly changing the platform, without anticipating on these changes you will miss opportunites for growth (need some examples here, like the new text ad format that's in beta now) and current performance will decrease (need some examples here as well, like Google automatically adding autogenerated ads that do not perform well).  

* The competition is constantly changing (not as strong as the first argument in my opinion, need examples when this really is a problem).  

* The searchers behavior is constantly changing (also, not as strong of an argument i think, for most of my clients search behavior is relatively static next to seasonality influences ofcourse).

313,"Anyone getting hammered by “Google Local Services”? Any solution?Hi,

For a while, one of my biggest lead drivers has been AdWords. Recently, Google launched “Google Local Services” in my area and apart from it taking me more than a month to actually sign up, for no reason, even with daily calls to Google, it’s been extraordinarily frustrating. What I’ve been seeing is a major drop off in CTR on my AdWords campaigns - explained probably by the  “local services” bar they place at the top of the page with “google guaranteed” vendors. 

Local services listings flattens the playing field and makes it impossible to actually stand out (vs being able to write better copy, adjust bids, etc.). We’ve got a ton of honest reviews and a 5 star average, but google will just as happily display a company with a single 5 star review as “5 Stars”. If you want to be listed first, you can, for $21 per phone call - which wouldn’t be an outrageous cost, but the platform definitely encourages price shopping since every provider’s profile ultimately looks the same. 

What can be done? Any local services businesses that have been hit by this? How are you working around this? We’ve had an amazing growth year leading up to this and I feel like we’re hitting a wall with this new frustrating change. "

I am having a problem with a display campaign.
My client has a live gambling site and he gave me some banners for display.
The problem is Google goes with those banners only on a few sites and youtube despite any targeting i use. When i exclude youtube, the only place those ads go are just 2 sites.
I tried changing the bidding system from cpc to vcpm but that wont change anything.
The client is pissed too that he sees ads from his competitors but his are just on just a few sites.

The way I see it, I have two options:

1. Create a landing page for each city (e.g. *Cleaning Services New York*, *Cleaning Services Chicago*, etc.)
2. Create a single landing page and use dynamic text to modify the city name throughout the page.

No doubt, #2 is far easier when dealing with &gt;50 cities. Especially if I want to make page changes down the road.

**My question is whether AdWords (ahem...Google Ads) would give greater Quality Scores to individual city pages or if the dynamic text works just as well in terms of on-page keyword relevance.** Landing page experience wouldn't theoretically be impacted.

Thoughts? I'd love to go with #2, but only if there's no negative impact."

The SKAGs are directed to one of 18 landing pages. Most landing pages are focused around a product type (laptop, printer, server, etc.) but some (including the one that I have linked to below) are a bit more generic.

The SKAGs' QS range from 2 to 8.

The SKAG with the highest impression/click volume is for the base term ""electronics recycling"". Essentially, it is a catch all for all of the terms that are not picked up by the more specific SKAGs.

This SKAG has a 4/10 QS.

Here is the basic data for this SKAG.

352,"How many campaigns/platforms is manageable for one person?Hello PPC!

I've been a in-house PPC specialist for just over a year now, and I was hoping to get some insight regarding managing large accounts/platforms.

Background: I've been employed by the same company for just over a year, and prior to this I learned PPC while interning at a company who used Facebook as a sole provider of app downloads. I'm talking a monthly budget of $100k, and part of a three person team (Intern, Specialist, Manager).   


My current company started PPC off fairly slow. They ran little to nothing on Facebook, Adwords or any other PPC platform prior to my arrival, which I quickly ramped up. The whole company has been extremely happy with my results, and they've given me more and more responsibility in attaining large, and sometimes lofty goals.   


Issue: I'm starting to feel worn down by the quantity of campaigns I have to manage. Our business deals with very niche audiences across thousands of locations. At any given moment I am running 50 or so FB campaigns (At one point I was running 125) with a budget in the thousands per day. Now we're planning to expand Adwords, but my time is locked into Facebook. My day-to-day work consists solely of managing what we have at this time, with little to no time set aside to try experiments, new platforms or anything that I believe would give us new avenues/ways to acquire users. I have voiced these concerns, but to little to no avail.   


Every day another task is placed in my lap, and I fully believe that despite taking the time to set up a new platform or campaign(s), I cannot give it the full attention it deserves.

What I would like to know is what is reasonable for someone to manage on their own within a 9-5 job, and what type of salary (Canada/Toronto) should I be expecting?

We provide Universal App Campaigns (Google Ads) for our customer, which leads people directly to the App Store page where they can install.

After installation, users will have to register through a button in-app, which will bring the user to a registration form in a browser. Sadly those registrations cannot be reduced to the Universal App Campaign, because the tracking is 'lost' when clicking the 'Register' button in-app.

To make it schematically:

Universal App Campaign --&gt; App Store --&gt; Install --&gt; Open app --&gt; \*Tap Register --&gt; Go to browser --&gt; Register

\*This is where the tracking from UAC is lost.

When you do detailed zip code targeting in Bing, it assumes you are trying to target the whole area.  For example, we were targeting 50 zip codes in Philly and Bing thought we were trying to target all of Pennsylvania, so it “did us a favor and added the whole state to our location targeting.

Is this the best option? I know this can be done in one account through individual campaigns, but for accounting/payment reasons, management wants everything separated.

The keywords in this second account would be brand specific and something we don't even bid on in the first account.

Since these two accounts would be driving traffic to the same domain, how do I protect our accounts from violating Google's double serving policy?

If all of the above is fine, what would be the best steps for conversion tracking with this second account? Could I add the conversion code into our GTM container?"

I'm not usually one to post up generic ""help me please"" posts, but my ads are not performing AT ALL compared to which they used to last year.

I'll post my info below:

**Industry:** Junk/Garbage Removal.  
**Area:** Chose radius about 10km around a specific location, which I want to keep. Large city.  
**Budget:** I currently have just over $5,000 in credit on my account, and hope to make the best of it over the next couple of months.  
I'm running **search/text ads** and targeting front page, top of search. People are sent to my landing page.  
Current land on search results is about **3.8 - 4.4.**  
The value of a conversion to me ranges from $150 - $600+   
**Current CTR &amp; CPC:** 2.8% - 3% and $3.50.  
**Keywords** are pretty darn generic, includes negatives such as *free*, and areas that I don't service yet.  
**Daily budget** is set to $40, but it hasn't been hitting this amount at all, maybe around $15 a day. I would like to increase the budget once I know my ads are converting better.

I really just want to generate more leads, and more people either calling my business and/or booking the service online. Hence the landing page. Seems as though the people clicking the ads do not call or book the service as often as they should for someone clicking the ad.. I created these advertisements last year, and they performed great. Not so much anymore. Should I create an entirely new campaign?

I hope this is a decent amount of initial information- look forward to reading some of your responses!"

Dear Google Ads Advertiser,
You are receiving this message because your Google Ads account contains at least one Google Display Network (GDN) campaign that will be impacted by upcoming changes to mobile targeting and placement exclusion controls. 

What's changing

In September 2018, the ad﻿senseform﻿obile﻿a﻿p﻿p﻿s.﻿c﻿o﻿m exclusion and the GMob mobile app non-interstitial exclusion will no longer be available within Google Ads. Device settings will also be consolidated into three device types: computer, mobile and tablet.

This change simplifies how you reach mobile users across the web and on apps, and it may impact if and how your ads show in mobile apps. As a result of these updates, you may see a significant increase in mobile apps traffic or mobile web traffic depending on your current settings.

Next Steps

To help ensure that your ads appear within apps and across sites as expected, adjust your existing controls to meet your campaign goals before September 1, 2018. Visit the Help Center to learn how to make these changes. If you have any questions about these updates, please don't hesitate to reach out to your account team or contact us at any time.

Sincerely,

The Google Ads team

398,"Do you guys normally optimize for cost per conversion (cost per acquisition) OR conversion volume?Hi guys,

My question is universal (i.e.: applies to all sorts of advertising platform). In general, is it better to optimize for CPA or conversion volume?

Let's say a campaign had 2 ads:

Ad 1: Total spend = $5,000; conversion = 200; cost per conversion (CPA) = $25

Ad 2: Total spend = $33,750; conversion = 450; cost per conversion (CPA) = $75

So, Ad 1 has a much lower (better) CPA ($25) but lower conversion volume (200), whereas Ad 2 has a much higher conversion volume (450), but much higher (worse) CPA ($75). That's a dilemma!

(Let's just assume the differences between those 2 ads are statistically significant.)

Which one would you optimize? And what's the logic behind that?"

Now need to create another branded campaign for another type of ink cartridge. We want to use +canon +ink +cartridge again due to its high search volume. If we don't use it the second campaign will get low search volume.

402,"[Facebook Ads] Question: Difference between Page Post versus Conversion Ad?Hi all,

I manage FB ads for a retailer and I have always wondered about the effect of using page boosts. 
  
  
About 99% of the ads that I set up are focused on driving ROI, and typically always use Conversion optimization. However, I have had some success with page boosting to Fans/Friends Of Fans. If I get lucky, I can drive a solid ROI for a fraction of the CPC. A small budget of $10 can drive decent revenue and a solid $0.02-$0.04 cents per click versus $.25+ for conversion.  Usually I will just hit the button to boost on the page post in addition to segmenting out web traffic/custom audiences etc. 
  
That being said, I am wondering why the Link Click CPC is so low for these types of ads. I understand they are optimized towards driving engagement but does this mean they get a decent placement/frequency for who I am targeting? 
  
  
Basically I just want to understand what is the exact difference between engagement optimized ads vs conversion optimized ads? Are these ads different in any way such as behave differently or have better placement in terms of delivery? Does a boosted post look any different than a conversion ad with a page post creative? I am very grateful for any insight this sub can provide. Thanks in advance and Happy PPCing yall"

405,"Question from a NewbieI've read in other marketing subreddits that if you're looking to break into DM, having a project or two under your belt is a great way to entice employers.

This is much easier with SEO, since you can conduct site audits, keyword research, competitor analysis, and more without your own website. You can pretend some website owner is your client, crawl their website for errors, etc.

But with PPC, you have to design a landing page and claim ownership over one yourself.

Now the question is, do you just haphazardly throw up a Wordpress website, slap a theme on it, and spend a couple days building it up and then run a PPC campaign with a decent landing page, or is there some other way to implement PPC? 

(Spending 2 weeks on a throwaway website doesn't seem like the best use of time to me.)

This happened a third time a few hours later, and I did it again. At that point I received an email saying that my ads were back online and the errors went away.

The next day I noticed three separate charges for $2000, totaling $6000. This overdrafted my bank account. I immediately called my bank to cancel the extra $4000. They told me that they would need Google to fax them a document on their letterhead explaining that it was an error. I spent a couple hours on the phone with Google and they said they could not do that. They said all they could do is refund me in two weeks. I scrambled for money and got a temporary loan from a family member to cover the overdraft.

Now, I specifically asked them if my credit would stay on until the refund is issued, and they told me that it would and that I would not be charged anymore as long as that credit is on the account. Today I went to run payroll, and noticed Google has charged me twice for $500 and once for $1000, totaling another $2000. I logged into my Ads account, and I still have over a $4000 credit.

I called them immediately, was placed on hold, and then told I would receive a callback within 24 hours. I asked if I could speak to someone else as this is an emergency (I have to cover payroll), and they would not respond.

I know this is a common gripe with Adwords/Google Ads, but I've come across something I've never seen before and just wanted to see what everyone else's experience was..

It was my understanding that if you're on a bid optimisation strategy then Google can overspend on your budget, assuming that it comes in on target for an average month. So if you have £10 a day then it can overspend more than twice that amount on any given day assuming the total for the month doesn't go over about £300 in total. This is obviously terrible as you can't control it on a granular basis, but I thought it was limited solely to optimisation strategies.

I've recently experienced a bunch of campaigns spending way more than the daily budget, but all of them are on Manual CPC, not even with enhanced CPC. Has this changed recently??

It's a total pain in the arse because I now have to explain to a client why I've overspent by about £300 with 2 days still to go in the month. Screw you Google, you utter twats.

441,"Facebook won't spend my budgetHi there,

I'm asking the community to help me figure out this problem. I have run several mid-budget ($1000/day) campaigns in Facebook in the past, my total spend is about $60,000. In my experience, even during the learning phase, Facebook picks up the campaigns fairly fast and tries to spend all your budget.

Recently I have set up 3 new campaigns and they have been running for days or weeks without getting any significant reach. Their audience (LAL) is in the millions, bidding is ""lowest-cost"" without a cap, the content is fine (no text, some old, some new), generally optimized for purchases.

It's very frustrating, I don't understand why they don't get any reach (well, a few dozens a day) and how is Facebook going to ever go through the learning phase at this pace.

Things I have tried:

* change conversion event to upper in the funnel
* change audiences 
* check for overlapping audiences 
* change bidding to target cost
* duplicate ad sets and try running again
* checking with a Facebook support rep that I don't have some sort of shadow-ban

None of them helped.

Your advice would be much appreciated."

445,"Use existing post (ID) for stories?So for obvious reasons I use existing posts when running ads in order to garner more and more social proof. 

For whatever reason i've only used IG stories for retargetting. Actually the whatever reason is because I can't seem to find a way to use an existing feed post for the feed ad while running IG story ads at the same time and was too lazy to actually do some asking and research so now here I am.

What I mean is. When you're creating the adset and you select FB/IG feed only then go on to the ad level and you select the existing post tab, you can enter the post ID and publish no problem.

But when you're creating the adset and you select FB/IG feed ALONG with IG stories then go to the ad level and you select the existing post tab, you can enter the post ID but it doesn't ask you to either enter existing story ID or to even create a new one.

Does this mean that people who do IG story ads and have let's say 50 adsets, they are constantly creating new stories AND posts for each of those adsets? I have no problem creating new stories for each adset/ad since I can just duplicate the adset/ad and change whatever needs to be changed on the adset level. That being said, I want to use the same existing IG/FB feed post in order to retain the social proof.

If we are working with an ecommerce platform like magento / shopify / woocommerce, do we have to manually install event tracking codes? Or is it automatically tracked once the pixel is installed?

However the pixel is installed via GTM and I can actually choose conversion events AKA add to cart, initiate checkout, purchase, does that mean i do not have to manually add event tracking anymore?

Nonetheless, I set up Google Ads for the company I'm working, including: Search Ads, Remarketing Display Ads and PLA ads. I spent around $1129 on AdWords and the total transaction Value from GA is $15,572 (the total revenue from all sales where someone clicked on my ads).

Using the positon-based attribution model for all the different campaigns the revenue shows as $4,654.85, which is still a 412% ROAS. I'm still not convinced if this is trustworthy, because for example for half of our PLA search queries we rank #1 or at least the top 3 in organic, and maybe people would've clicked anyway, especially if it wasn't even a first click interaction.

I feel like the same goes for a lot of retargetting campaigns, that are hard to prove if a customer was going to buy from us anyway.

496,"Sudden Decrease in Impressions And Clicks For AdWords Display CampaignHi

Since taking over an account about 2 weeks ago (mid Jul), there has been a sharp decrease in the  Clicks (dropped by half) for my display campaign. As a result of the significant decrease in clicks, the CTR has also increased. I do not recall making any changes to the campaign (have checked Adword's change history to confirm, and no changes have been reflected in the history), and am wondering what could have attributed to the decrease.

I have checked the site analytics, and was notified that there was a significantly longer page load load time for the landing page URL during the month of June. Could that have also contributed to a lower quality score, and hence to the sharp decrease in clicks and impressions?

During my online research, i read that there may be competitors who are bidding for similar keywords and audiences more aggressively, which have resulted in my display ad being shown less. Is that a possibility, and if yes, is there a way to check the competition?

**Some info about the campaign**

Bidding Strategy - vCPM

CTR for Ad - Very poor

Targeting - Keywords &amp; Audience

Ad Groups - 1

Ad Copy - 1

Daily Budget - Limited (have been notified that the ads stopped running on one of the busiest days)

**An Update:**

I'ved checked the trend of the clicks &amp; impressions over the past month, and noticed something a little strange. The trend of the impressions has largely remained consistent. However the trend for the clicks seem not to have been affected by the impressions.

**Clicks**

4 July - 8 July: Clicks increased till an all time peak

520,"Bing now has a Display Network: here’s how to use it/not get used by it.Yeah, so Bing Ads just rolled out its “forced display network” called ‘audiences’ so it can money-grub on bad targeting with questionable results just like the Google Display Network.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/searchengineland.com/microsoft-launches-new-audience-network-audience-ads-at-bing-partner-summit-297336/amp

Now, you’re already using it if you use Bing Ads—but it’s possible no one told you.

You have to sneakily shut it off for all Bing Ads campaigns by adding a bid adjustment in campaign settings at the *very* bottom. (And if you’ve wondered why Bing Ads suddenly started spending all of your money more quickly with questionable results and a strange reporting row called “audience total, this is why).

But back to the topic at-hand. Using image extensions and Google-style propensity to turn text-based/search ads into display ads, Bing Ads’ “audience” functionality does the same thing; that is, activates display-style advertising across their partner network.

So how do you use it? Create search ads in Bing Ads and add image extensions. Give them a bid amount of 25% of what you normally would for minimal performance (that is, undercut the search ad bids so they won’t perform/spend much of anything).

Then in campaign settings, go to the bottom and add an “audience” bid adjustment of ‘increase by 300%’.
($10 bid times .25= $2.50 +300%increase[$7.50] = original $10 target bid, for example).

Welcome to the display network: back-asswords Microsoft style.

Your reporting is in the “audience total” row of most campaign/ad groups/keywords views (aka place to which your adspend has been mysteriously going for the last couple months).

You were very helpful with my last post, whereby I was struggling with whether or not to continue Facebook ads. 

I have just finished a AdWords campaign - my first whereby I have set everything up correctly (different ads, landing pages etc)

I spent £100 on the ads. Sadly, no results yet (my ultimate goal is to sell my products - decor and furniture serving the mid - high end markets/affordable luxury)

Now, of course I'm conscious of wasting money, but from you advice I recognise the need to be a bit more relaxed about spend. 

This weekend, I'm going to try and start afresh. Say, for example, spend £200 on ads. I'm struggling to pinpoint my exact market in all honesty. There is so much information on the internet which can be overwhelming and never quite sure what direction to go in.

Ultimately, I'd love to understand how you would approach this PPC campaign. Is Facebook worth another shot? If I do another AdWords campaign with the same campaign details as I have just done, will this likely lead to another £100 in wasted spend?

Your advice and expertise would be very much appreciated!!

Cheers! "

Facebook :

It is different due to one having more impressions than the other, 22,696 versus 4,554.

*Me :*

\*I believe it's the other way around. One got more impressions than the other (despite similar spend) because facebook determined it more expensive to run one ad to the other.\*Facebook :CPM = Amount spent ($86.51) divided by impressions (22,696) x 1000 = $3.81That is for Ad Set XXXXX, specifically.*Me :*

*I understand that facebook determines the cost of running an ad (CPM) based on audience size, relevance score etc.I'm trying to determine why FAcebook determined one is about 5 times more expensive than the other when they have identical audience and relevance scores.*

Facebook :It's because the math is different.For Ad Set XXX, CPM = Amount spent ($86.51) divided by impressions (22,696) x 1000 = $3.81For Ad Set XXX, CPM = $70.73 divided by 4,554 x1000 = $15.53Because they each spent a different amount and had a different running time, the numbers will be different, even though relevance is the same.

*(time that ran was a little different but it's not as if they were hours apart*)

*Me :*

*The CPM is determined by FAcebook's perceived quality of an ad/ adset.I'm trying to determine why Facebook is determining one ad/ad set combination to be of higher quality than another when they are identical.*

Facebook :CPM is not determined by the ad quality, only the relevance score is determined this way. CPM is calculated via the formula I shared with you, which you can also see if you hover over the CPM column and click ""see more"". Relevance score has absolutely no bearing on a CPM calculation.*Me :*

*Are you suggesting that the CPM is not affected by the relevance score?I'm sorry, but that's not true ...Thank you for your help. Good day.*

We've started to release some free mcc level scripts.

I wanted to share the first one which is automated keyword bid management, it can manage hundreds of accounts and make millions of bids changes each day - if needed.

It's a massive time saver, and that's no understatement.

It was created because 'smart bidding' such as tCPA doesn’t work for every campaign or account. If you’re getting less than 1-2 conversions a day per campaign,  target CPA and target ROAS just seem to struggle. They’re data hungry.

So we created - and have been using for over a year - our own bid manager.

I do SEO for a web dev agency, and a little PPC for some clients, I'm pretty new to the company so a lot of the clients are not ideally set up and I'm not familiar with all the non-seo accounts yet.

We have an existing client who has in house PPC. 

The issue is the PPC campaign conversions are being attributed to direct traffic. They asked me to take a look, but I'm not familiar with the client nor their website set up. While my GA is pretty decent I rarely check anything to do with PPC campaigns, other than keyword reports. 

https://imgur.com/5LmHuNa

The client uses Paypal for all payments, and we can't install a direct payment option. I am assuming that somehwhere in the users journey the session sdata is being stripped out and the return path after a successful conversion is being treated as direct. 

My first check was to see if the referral exclusion filter was in place, it was. But it is not keeping session data alive.  

https://imgur.com/Xuf8udH

I have spent the last few days trying to figure what else is causing it, when I found a single HTTP page in the conversion path. 

I thought this was the error causing the drop of session data so I had the dev fix the HTTP page to HTTPS so all of the connecting pages are HTTPS, when I checked conversions this morning they were still direct attributed.

https://imgur.com/V9h6T82

Is there any other reason the filter would not keep the session active? Or have I missunderstood the process in GA. 

How do PPC campaigns with 3rd party payments normally get tracked? 

I'll xpost this in an analytics thread later if it is more suitable there. But since this seemed to be a ppc related issue I figured someone here would've handled this before, or could let me know a better option.

555,"Terrible Delivery On Facebook Lead AdsI'm more of an Adwords person, but helping someone I know run some basic Facebook Lead ads (they are promoting a free training course).

There are 2 variations to the course, targeting 2 different audiences. Both campaigns are targeted to a combination of location + interest (different interests as well).

The estimated audience size for each is about 20,000, but we are getting less than 30 impressions per day. I haven't set a cap to lead cost on either campaign, and budget is at $10 per day for each campaign.

One potential issue I can see is that the client is required by the course administrator to use very specific images and ad copy. They cannot deviate from this for various reasons. The ad copy contains a request to call or email (including email &amp; phone numbers) which does counteract the purpose of the lead ads somewhat. Also, the images are not eye-catching or engaging at all. 

What is likely causing this poor delivery issue? It's not even as if we are getting delivery but no results, we just aren't getting the ads in front of enough people. "
556,"Having trouble vertically scaling Facebook adsSo I've had a lot of success last year during the holidays with my one of my businesses (did over $1-million in revenue in 2 months), but I'm having a bit of trouble with a new business I started this year. 

Basically, I have a buncha profitable / successful test ads, but every time I try to scale them vertically, they always flop.

I've tried duplicating the ad set and increasing the budget while setting a manual bid (I've tried both target cost and lowest cost with a bid cap), but my CPA is always double that of the test ads. This was the strategy that's always worked for me, but now it seems like it's just not getting me the same CPAs/CPPs I've been used to. 

  
Should I stick to just increasing my budget of the ad by 20% every few days? Or is there another strategy that I should try out?

I've even tried things like splitting the ads by age and then scaling those, but that hasn't been too successful either.

I have a a few questions regarding current ads that are running versus what we have read (crash course) about best practices.

Campaign A: Conversion Objective, Optimized for Website Purchase Conversion, Broad 2% Lookalike Audience based on past visitors, Ad is a multiple-image carousel filled dynamically from our sitewide Shopify product set.

Are there any advantages/disadvantages to having this setup versus a campaign that uses the 'Product Catalog Sales' Conversion objective, and targeting the same Broad 2% Lookalike Audience and product set? Is one smarter over the other? Is Campaign A the old school way of doing what Product Catalog Sales was created to do? We have our pixel active and have a different 'Product Catalog Sales' remarketing campaign targeting how past visitors have interacted with the site that is very successful for us.

There is another Campaign that was created with Conversion Objective, same setup and audience as campaign A, that has manual images shown (kind of like a best hits) which we understand would be necessary to have as a Conversion Objective because you are unable to create an entirely manual set of cards in a Product Catalog Sales campaign.

1. Facebook advertisement is dead
2. It is only a way of making Mark richer
3.  This method is over hyped by internet marketers who wants to make money from hungry newbies

I used to believe that many months ago until I found a way of making Facebook work for me by using the right mechanism to target the right audience, market research and not giving up is a way of making Facebook advertisement work the right way. I am so surprised on what we have achieved for clients in the last few months. Which includes:

1. Growing a group to 1 million members in 3 months
2.  Growing a page to 100k likes in less than 1 month
3.  Getting thousands of new leads per day for clients

All this can be achieved if you: 

1. Target the right audience
2. Do your market research
3. Analyse your business demography
4. Educate yourself about Facebook keywords like engagement, likes, comments.......
5. Understand the type of contents your audience want.
6. Find a niche market and understand it

I run an ecommerce business on Shopify. I have been using Google Adwords for over 2 years and had a great max CPA campaign getting me conversions for £6 per result. 

Last month I noticed Google Adwords was not showing the same conversions as what Google Analytics was showing, so I decided to add to the tracking code to make it count orders with different order numbers (I am unsure if this is where the problem started but it was on the same day). I then went on holiday for a couple weeks and forgot to check how my Google Adwords was going.

I have noticed a pretty big drop in sales, I usually get at least 100 per day and now I am getting around 60. At first I thought it was due to me being on holiday and not putting as much effort into PPC, but now I have realised its coz my Google Adwords tracking has stopped working, and Google stopped spending any of my money as I was not making the £6 CPA I was asking for. 

I have now got the conversion tracking working again, my question is - will I need to start CPC campaign or will my CPA campaign work again?

577,"What can cause a massive and increasing drop in impressions and clicks? (Google AdWords)Hello All, I have been managing a client's AdWords account for almost 5 years now, that has only ever required mild tweaking here and there, but otherwise has been performing well. However, since starting in March of 2018, impressions have dropped significantly, and have continued to drop. Along with this, clicks and conversions have also dropped. For reference, on average the campaign in question would receive about 500,000 impressions per month for the last 3 years, then in March it dropped to 300,000, then in April to 238,000, May 128,000, and has leveled off at that since.

I've checked the usual suspects, but to no avail.

\-Demand is still strong (Google Trends indicates no downswing in KW interest and the corresponding Bing campaign shows no decreases in impr or clicks)

\-Competitive Metrics have actually IMPROVED, which is mind boggling. Search Lost IS rank has dropped, and search impr. share has increased over this time. Average position of ads has actually improved as well.

\-Looking at the change history, no significant changes have been made to the campaign in February or March. The only significant change I added was implementing general remarketing lists in early April, which I have since removed to see if that was causing the problem.

\-Auction insights show nothing remarkable. A new competitor has entered the field, but our ads have a better position and impression share.

\-Interestingly enough, CTR has increased, while avg CPC has remained the same.

\-Campaign is SEARCH only, manual CPC, USA.

I'm at a complete loss for this. Ive been working on it for the past two months and cannot find the cause. See Ad Groups pic for the magnitude of impression and click loss.  [https://imgur.com/a/uoECZsZ](https://imgur.com/a/uoECZsZ)"

});

I understand that there's a way of setting specific parameters inside of an Event and there's certain Events that can only pass certain parameters. But what's confusing is how these parameters, say, map to a Product Catalog for dynamic remarketing? Or if you're not using them for dynamic remarketing, is there any value to including them at all? 

Moreover, every example seems to have some kind of dummy string inside of it. I think I get that some parameters require a string but, for example, search\_string, does that require a hard-coded string inside of it? Or is there something that needs to be done to make it so it's dynamic and reads out whatever a user searched in, what I guess is, a Search box that the FB Pixel understands is on the site in some capacity.

I feel like I've exhausted every resource I can find on this and still feel wildly confused about the whole thing and Facebook Support isn't helpful at all here as well.

\- Polish is not a supported language in Bing Ads.

\- You can actually use location targeting to target Poland.

\- Due to how Bing targets users, using the default 'English' language targeting in combination with location targeting for Poland, would mean that users would only see the ad if they are browsing with English language settings whilst in Poland.

\+Volcom +shirts

\+Volcom +shirts +online

\+Volcom +shirts +us

What would be best practices for our negative keywords in this case? Of course there's not a lot of info but all I'm trying to work out is to know how to create your list of keywords when you have a BMM campaign for your brand search.

Thanks to anyone who could give me a hand!"
607,"Question on custom conversions vs. standard eventsI hope all are well! I have two questions:

1) I have installed a FB pixel on my website to start generating data on the FB BM. 

Then, I created custom conversions on the TY Page URL and audiences based on the standard PageView from the FB pixel which is coming from all my website traffic sources. 

Finally, I have launched a new campaign with a conversion objective for the TY Page.

My question is: if I pull a report on this conversion only with a standard lookback window of 28-day click &amp; 1-day view, how can I interpret the conversion performance? am I seeing conversions from all my traffic sources that were impacted by my FB ads? 

2) I have installed standard events on my FB Pixel for ViewContent, AddtoCart and Purchases. 

The results are lower for my Purchases vs. my custom conversion TY Page even if it's on the same Page and the GTM &amp; FBHelper are working fine. Is the difference because Purchases are based on the ViewContent and not the PageView?

If I launch a campaign with a conversion objective towards the Standard Event Purchases. How can I interpret the data vs. custom conversions? Is it conversions generated only coming from my FB ads? What are the main differences as the numbers are very different, should they be different?

Thanks for your help guys for clarifying this topic!"
608,"Ultimate PPC Strategy for e-commerce stores?**Edited**

I think this seems to be more of a general basic PPC strategy 



My friend knows that I am into PPC and asked me to help him advertise his ecommerce store online (F &amp; B related).

However my experience and knowledge is limited with regards to ecommerce, but I am thinking that with AdWords and Facebook, there are some tried and tested PROVEN methods to increase transactions and sales. 

Do let me know if my proposed general strategy makes sense and if any improvements can be made. 

**AdWords**


-Search Campaigns (targeting product related keywords)


-Display Campaigns (for branding and awareness)


-Shopping Campaigns (merchant centre) 


-Remarketing Campaigns (display network)


-Dynamic Remarketing Campaigns (from google shopping campaign)


- Dynamic search ads? (not really a big fan)


-Youtube Video Campaigns (product features)


- Responsive search ads (beta)



**Facebook**


-Traffic + Conversion campaigns (video, single image, carousel) 


-Dynamic product ads


-General retargeting ads


-Lookalike audiences of current customers

610,"What's the future of HTML5 ads on AdWords?So I've been working on a new client with a fresh AdWords account. Been meaning to upload some HTML5 Ads, and got an error message that I've never seen before: ""Your HTML5 ad could not be uploaded. Your account does not support HTML5 ads"". I did some investigation, and found a [bunch](https://www.en.advertisercommunity.com/t5/AdWords-Account-Issues/quot-Your-HTML5-ad-could-not-be-uploaded-Your-account-does-not/td-p/1757596) of [threads](https://www.en.advertisercommunity.com/t5/AdWords-Account-Issues/quot-Your-HTML5-ad-could-not-be-uploaded-Your-account-does-not/td-p/1755588#.W0diN97hsH0.twitter) on the Advertiser Community. Seems like, starting June 27th of this year, Google only allows accounts that have already run HTML5 ads in the past to launch new ones.

There is a form to request approval [here](https://support.google.com/adwords/contact/html_5_access), for accounts that are in good standing.

What I'm mostly wondering about is what the bigger picture behind this is? I feel like it's quite a significant change, but hasn't been covered much in news and discussions. And it leaves me wondering what the overall strategy of Google is.

Is it a move towards phasing out HTML5 banners, and pushing everything towards generic responsive ads?"

614,"AdWords Intellectual Property?Any help much appreciated. FYI - I am based in the UK

I own a small business &amp; have a relationship with an ad agency for running an AdWords campaign. 

I recently contacted the person I deal with to ask to suspend their services for a period of time. In my request I asked for the agency to leave my campaign live but to stop maintaining it until further notice. 

This was all okay etc. However they are refusing to leave the campaign live as ‘they built the campaign and it is therefore their intellectual property so they would be responsible if anything went wrong’. 

This has seriously soured what has to date been quite a good relationship between us from my perspective. Before I respond to them, I want to get an idea of where exactly I stand legally etc. here. If they do not revise their stance, I would honestly not continue the relationship into the future as I would consider this to be them acting in very bad faith. 

I could be going way overkill with the above but want to know what the situation actually is before I contact them about this to ask them to reconsider just in case they start being obstructive. 

To be clear: I know AdWords campaigns should be monitored at all times etc. Please do not comment on this aspect of things - the timescales involved are relatively short. 

Some maybe helpful information:

Agency created the account using a new gmail email address. 

My company’s payment details are linked to the account - the agency is ONLY paid for their services - AdWords spend goes straight from us to Google via debit card. To be clear - the agency DO NOT pay google anything in any way, shape or form. 

No formal or informal (to my memory) terms and conditions have been agreed between us and them that would cover this scenario.

623,"Question about structure for traffic sculptingPretty new to Adwords. So I'm selling a product that is very geographically linked so people are searching for things like ""widgets in Stockholm"" (a city in Sweden). And since geography is very important I want to show the geographical area in my ads. I also have different products so I want to show different ads based on the product. This is how I done it: 

Everything in the same campaign: 

Adgroup - General - Buy widget X

Adgroup - General - Buy widget Y  


Adgroup - General - Buy widget Z  


Adgroup - Stockholm - Buy widget X  


Adgroup - Stockholm - Buy widget Y  


Adgroup - Stockholm - Buy widget Z

Adgroup - Malmö - Buy widget X  


Adgroup - Malmö - Buy widget Y  


Adgroup - Malmö - Buy widget Z  


and so on for the top 20 biggest cities

Then in each adgroup I will use modified broad matches. So in Stockholm I would have: 

\+Buy +widgetX +stockholm

\+shop +widgetX +stockholm

and so on

But I would also have for different parts of Stockholm:

\+Buy +widgetX +östermalm  


\+shop +widgetX +östermalm  


Then I would make negative keywords for all geographical locations and put in adgroups:

Adgroup - General - Buy widget X

Adgroup - General - Buy widget Y

Adgroup - General - Buy widget Z

So that if I search:

""buy widgetX östermalm"" I would be served an from Adgroup - Stockholm - Buy widget X but if I search ""buy widgetX"" or ""Buy widgetZ kiruna"" (a city that does not have its own adgroup) I would be served a more general ad from Adgroup - General - Buy widget X.

This way I can sculpt the traffic to the most relevant ads and everything that doesnt have its own adgroup will go to the general location adgroup that is the same for the whole country.

 I guess the problem will be that I will have over 200 000 different keywords just from the start only to cover the top 20 biggest cities. 

Seems like the could be a better way to do it. Any ideas or is this the best way to serve different ads for each city?"

Or precisely,why everybody talks about using the bid strategy and setting a minimum ROAS of 100&amp;#37;. I also saw about the formula to calculate your ROAS in the last 30 months,and if it's less than 100&amp;#37; ,then it's no good. The problem is, I tried calculating our ROAS and it resulted 0,2&amp;#37; aproximately. My question is, did I set something wrong on adwords? (I am fairly new to adwords but not a complete newbie). We have an ad that's been running for 2 months now, where we spent 938 € on the last 30 days , and got 24k impressions and 3,2k clicks, 13&amp;#37; ctr and 28€ cost per conversion, with a total of 33 conversions. I am constantly trying to get conversions at a lower price (we're in the car renting business, a conversion is a form request for a car),and trying every strategy i can think of: modified broad or exact match, by location, by hours and by device. Tried most automatic biddings and the above was the result. Manual cpc didnt do me much good sadly, and cpa is inconsistent i think. I read all day about ROAS but when i calculated mine it was 0,2&amp;#37; :(

Any feedback is appreciated,including on the ROAS side, but specially if i could improve the campaign and get more conversions in any way.

NOTE: I can't estimate how much the company is making monthly and compare it with the spent ad,since i don't have access to that data,nor do I own the account. They already had it set up. I just worked on it and made it better,since they originally weren't getting roughly 10 conversions per month and we're spending much more.

I've had my small business for around 8 months, and had dabbled with PPC overtime. Now I realise the urgency and necessity - if I don't get people to my site I don't make money. 

I like to think that I have picked up Google AdWords rather well, and now understand everything which I think is relevant to my business. I haven't seen great results, but I'm confident that eventually the visitors will convert (I sell relatively high ticket items) and haven't spent too much. 

I am extremely frustrated with Facebook Ads to the point where I feel like giving up on PPC (and in turn, my business) altogether. A few months ago, I spent £30 and got 200 link clicks, and 1 or 2 sales, the CPC was around £0.15 - great i thought. I tried it again...cost was around £0.35 per click - over double. 

Today, I tried some new Ads. I initially researched and selected my goal as conversation. I spent around £5 while noticing that this didn't bring me one visitor. Having spoken to Facebook, I then found out that I didn't have enough data for this option, so essentially wasted spend. I then tried Visits to site. I have had 6 clicks, at a cost of £1.20 each click. I don't understand why I am looking at 4x my original cost.

My question is, for all the (perceived) advantages of Facebook, should I purely concentrate on AdWords and totally give up on trying (and failing/getting frustrated) with Facebook Ads?

Cheers all!

Guessing those who are downvoting this thinking its a dumb/obvious question haven't actually tried this before. Google is blocked in China for those not aware. Which makes it more difficult than it seems.

Most traffic to Google from China is via VPN. Those with their language set to English most likely just have their settings misconfigured, are using a device from abroad, or are not actually Chinese, but foreigners living in China. Can't rely on the language setting in campaign settings.

I've been trying to make it work for awhile, and all of the traffic I'm getting are people who don't actually speak English, or are not Chinese. Best thing I've come up with is using Adwords display + custom audiences of common sites in China that Google would save cookies for + English language. Have even tried adding things like ""English Speaking"" in the ad content itself."
651,"Question about Target Audience for Hotels on FacebookI've been running Facebook ads for a local hotel client in a small Canadian city for the past 3 months. I've been targeting a few provinces in Canada as well as Behaviours such as Travel, Frequent Travellers etc. 

That being said, (1) do you think I should only be targeting cities within the province instead of the entire province and (2) should I even be including any other targeting options like behaviours or interests? Traveling is a bit tough to choose an audience for since everyone travels. My goal is to drive more clicks to the website."
652,"Segmenting Adwords groups by funnel- should this be on a campaign level or ad group level?Hello, I am restructuring an Adwords campaign. I decided to split keywords into groups based on where they are in the funnel, because I want to get more impressions and clicks for the keywords that will be more likely to convert. My only concern is that if I do this on an ad group level, the bottom of funnel ad groups will not do as well because they have a much lower search volume than the top of funnel ad groups.

Am I wrong about that?

Should I split these into different campaigns so that I can control the budget better? I already have 8 campaigns because of 5 different products, remarketing, branded keywords, and competitors.

Any advice would be much appreciated- thanks!"
653,"[Adwords] When do you start getting worried about QS after starting a new campaign?Hey guys,

I just wanted to ask if there is some 'quarantine' or some period after starting a new search campaign/account?

I am at day 4 now and these are pretty low search volume keywords I have, but I was getting 10-20 clicks per day (as expected) during day 1 and 2. Now my impressions have dropped quite dramatically lately and I got only 3 clicks last night (60% impressions lost due to Ad Rank).

Now my question is, when should I start worrying about QS? I already got QS assigned to some of my keywords and it doesn't really make sense too much to me yet. Some keywords with 0 clicks got 7 or 8, and some KWs got a miserable 2 or 3... One keyword got 17 impressions, 1 click, which is reasonable CTR I guess, but still has below average expected CTR and a QS of 2...

Is there some kind of timeframe how much I should wait before getting worried and before my campaign picks up?

654,"Facebook Ads - which agency or freelancer?I've avoided posting this for a few weeks now, but I figured it was time to stop holding off.

I see lots of people posting on Reddit and on forums that they're seeing huge success with Facebook Ads. We have a solid ecommerce website, but FB Ads have never really taken off for us. In the past we've used a big agency, who just blew a tonne of money on them for little or no return. The problem is there are so many agencies out there, we can't possibly work through them all, wasting cash, until we find one who actually know what they're doing.

I've done research on Google, posted on forums and even posted jobs on Upwork etc. How on earth do you find a solid, reliable FB Ads agency or freelancer to work with? Someone who's not going to blow all of your budget for no return, and someone who understands the importance of us seeing a quick ROI.

We literally just need to make the acquaintance of a reliable agency with a solid track record of delivering results, who have good comms. But finding that agency seems to be quite the challenge and I'm becoming a little tired of it.

Thoughts and advice most welcome..."
655,"Targeting HNWI using Google Display AdsHi,

I am struggling to target HNWI via Google display ads. We are selling high end properties. 

Adwords search campaign is performing very well but if target in display campaigns, its only giving number of clicks not the leads. Below targeting options, we are using:

1. Remarketing List based on search campaigns visitors.
2. Keywords but with broad variation 
3. Placements: List of all major websites in the region, 
4. Topics - we are not using
5. Interests - Investment Services, Residential Properties, Houses for Sale, New Houses, Apartments for sale

If we target based on the interests like Luxury Cars, Yachts etc. Here, problem is, we are targeting people who have interest but most of them dont have a budget to afford such lifestyle.

If anyone can suggest, how they get success in the display ads campaigns. By the way, our competitors are getting good leads via Display campaigns with very low cost per lead."

Around 4 weeks I scheduled a call with a Google rep (Indian fella), who advised me to change the bid strategy from Enhanced CPC to ROAS. This is when the huge drop in impressions began, I left it to finish ""Learning"" and hoping things would pick up, but it didn't.

7 days ago I changed my bid strategy back to Enhanced CPC which has no finished ""Learning"" but the daily impressions are not increasing, at all.

660,"Total Conversion Value not matching actual website revenueHey,

I am struggling to understand why my 'total conversion value' for yesterday is more than the total revenue number generated from my website! All of this revenue has a campaign and ad group attributed to it. Is this due to some transactions being counted more than once due to them appearing more than once in the journey of a sale? And more importantly, how do I fix it and make it more representational of actual performance? Conversion numbers are also more than we achieved.

664,"How long do you keep a client? (Local Biz.)Hey Reddit,

I'm about to kick off my journey freelancing for local biz. clients (using FB &amp; Insta ads for lead gen.). Before I dive in, there is one thing I need clarity on.

My question is, how long do you keep a client for? I'm sure the general answer will be ""as long as possible / until the money stops coming in"" but what I'm really trying to get at is:

Say I get a pet food store as a client, I run ads for a 20% off pet food coupon to generate leads.... but this can only go on for so long right?? At some point, it's going to reach every possible pet owner in the nearby area (assuming I exclude people that already signed up for the coupon.)

I guess I can speak with the owner to advertise local events that they may run like a ""dog play day"" or something.

My understanding is that I am here to get them more customers, consistently. Would this specific example of a client contract only be possible for 1 or 2 months then before I become irrelevant?

Just curious on your thoughts and what others have done for Local biz. clients.

Truly appreciated."

666,"Does higher CPC = better quality traffic? Or should I maximize clicks?Does higher CPC result in any better quality traffic or is it better to lower CPC to maximize clicks for a given budget? I have my campaigns to target only in desired areas (in US only) and only during daytime hours to avoid ""bad"" clicks.  I almost never have an issue using my daily budget.  A couple campaigns can burn through budget pretty quickly, especially with accelerated delivery.

Does it make sense to keep lowering bids, or will the really cheap bids only get me low quality clicks?

670,"Product with lots of engagements and visits, but little sales.I've done my product research and finally found a product that gave me lots of engagements and site visits.

And this is the product that have gotten me a few sales. It's not much, but it means a lot to me as a stepping stone to more sales.

The thing is, I've only gotten this sale on the first day of ad run ($5 PUR). Continuous ad run only gives sale on like every 2 to 3 days. And the visits slightly decline over time too.

**What would you have done here?** **(Or have done it.)** **Budget increase?** **Find bigger relevant audience?**

This product had to date almost 500 post reactions, and lots of tags and comments saying 'I need this', 'It matches my other items.'. This is a home decor item.

I had few possible audiences prep up for this product, so I swapped for other audience. But same result, first day sale but not consecutively."
671,"[FB] Why is spending money to get fans not recommended ?I often read articles that say 'likes' aren't really worth anything, and that's it's not recommended to invest too much into getting them.

I don't really understand why people say this. When someone likes my page they also become a follower. When I then post a new message on my timeline, a part of these followers see the message, right ? This could then convince them to perform an action like purchasing something.

Below my posts I can see the amount of views. These are usually around 1K which is 1/3 of my fan base. Not a lot, I know but I'm working on that.

Anyways, is this means that 1/3 of my fan base always sees my new posts, then how is it not interesting to get more likes ? If it was 100K people and my posts would get 30K views, then I'm pretty sure I'd make several sales for the featured product. And it wouldn't cost me anything (aside from the investment to get the fan base initially)

How do you guys feel about this ? Am I wrong in thinking this way ?"
672,"[FB] Share your favorite method to get more likesI often read that in order to get more likes I have to create interesting content and share it on my business page.

I have an e-commerce shop where I sell women's footwear. I use Canva to create a nice image with a product together with some USP's and call-to-action.

But I have a hard time getting more likes on my page. I don't really see what other type of content I could create since selling shoes is all I do.

Something I put an offer on the page, or advertise a sale. But the amount of like I get is minimal. And when they do 'like' they like the post, not always the page which prevents them from becoming a follower and see my future posts.

I try to keep an eye on my competition who have +100K likes and they don't seem to do anything different. The major difference is that they exist longer that me and they have a lot of contests (where liking, commenting is required, and sometimes sharing too which isn't even allowed)

I'm very curious on how other people here increase their fan base on Facebook. Can you give me any advice ?"

When I post something I notice a small bump (20%) in user visits (viewed in Google Analytics) on my site.

My question is how many posts a day is recommended. I assume too many would perhaps annoy people who would then unfollow my page. But at the same time I'd like to create more of these 'bumps' in user visits in hopes to get a sale.

My store sells footwear for women. How many posts a day do you guys think would be enough ?"
675,"Should An Agency Give A Competing Agency Ownership Of Account They Built When Client Leaves?I work 9-5 managing PPC at an agency. I started doing AdWords side work at a discounted rate for a friend. This slowly crept into additional work like managing Bing, etc. That's my own fault for not putting my foot down. I got him tons of leads and based on search terms report and user behavior on site, I can tell they were good leads. He just couldn't close very many of them (its a very competitive industry he's in). Even still, he was definitely ROI positive and will probably get at least ONE more from the leads that were generated, to the tune of somethign like $20k or more each.

Now because of him not closing enough deals, he tells me a week into this month (after we had an hour long strategy call, after I did work and without him paying for this month) that he's going to use a random guy who supposedly ""specializes"" in his industry. I created this account under my MCC and my client had Read Only Access.

Now that he switched, this new, competing agency is asking for me to send them the account. I put in a lot of work and have a pretty big problem with them getting access to everything I did. My client was only paying for management of the account that I created.

I know that the easiest way is to just give them access but I honestly don't want to. And at work, the only accounts we give clients are the nonprofit ad grant accounts because its actually their CID that's linked to their ad grant. Paid accounts are required to buy the account from us when they leave if they want it. I'm happy to send a detailed report of all historical data which I absolutely feel they are entitled to. But as far as using and profiting from my build, account structure and strategy, I don't think I was compensated for nor contractually obligated to hand over all of that to a direct competitor of mine.

None of the campaigns are on an accelerated delivery schedule. Some of these 10 minute periods are 0:00 average page duration-- this is what kills me, we're getting for 20 minutes a day with 0:00 page duration.

I've talked to Google 6 times now, 2 times each week, and every time they say nothing is wrong--until I make the call center rep that tells me this look at the account. They have agreed 3 times now that something is definitely wrong and have reopened the 'investigation.'

The general stats of the campaigns are 25 mile radius (give or take), decently curated keywords (and negatives), $600-$900 weekly budget, 1 display network campaign, 5 search network campaigns. Display vs Search doesn't seem to matter either, these 10 minute windows hit everything.

686,"Ideas for auditing all random settings in a messy Adwords acctHi /r/ppc, quick question. I've recently come on board at a company that has had a half-dozen different people in the adwords account, and the number of different overlapping philosophies and settings is staggering. 
Examples:

1)Different tracking templates applied at different levels with different variable names, some of which are obviously copied and pasted from some agencies other clients and expects us to capture parameters we don't have.  

2)An insane number of ad extensions applied at different levels, often with just terrible language..

3)a wide variety of targeting and bid adjustments on random levels etc

I cut all the fat and fixed a few things, which brought our ROAS from 105% to 185% in my first week, but there's a fluctuation that appears to me to be more than average, and I believe it's probably because a few agencies imported negative kys and possibly scripts, and all sorts of things that are hurting our performance.

I also tried increasin my CPA bid 3x but still did not see any volume increase in terms of clicks and impressions.

Is there anything im possibly missing out on? 
Has this ever happened to any of you and what can the possible solutions be toh improve the situation?

697,"Best FB ad type for ecommerce top of funnel?What does generally work best? Should I use brand awareness with video at all? Should I use directly video? And then remarket those for engagement?

Or go straight for product carousel ads? Or try to get traffic to the site and then just remarket to those?

I find it difficult to find cheap top of the funnel traffic, and I'm even using some lookalike audiences based on page engagement and another video ad I had before that was just a product slideshow.

Also I find that if I try to go for the ""interrupt"" idea and ""talk to the audience directly"" approach, it may not work too well to get people to go to the site, as they feel maybe a little ""tricked"" by the ad, in the sense that they expected it to be something else, and I'm thinking it's better to just show them directly the products."

I ask because we're currently showing up on some 10,000 sites, 99% of which are clearly irrelevant and spammy. My problem is that there are very few sites there that add up to enough spend to stand out for exclusion.

707,"How to use Audience Insights to create better ads, get ideas for content for your blog, and form interesting partnerships One great thing about Audience Insights is that you can use if for more than just finding audiences to target. Here are some interesting ideas:

**Ads**: Use the  **Page Likes tab to** find relevant Pages and see the “tone” used in their posts and the type of photos and posts used. Be sure to check the languages tab. If you see there’s a percentage of people speaking speaking any language other than english (or your target language), you should consider translating your ads in that language (pro tip: use Dynamic Language Optimisation). 

Be sure to use dynamic creative in order to serve the best combination of ad copy and creative to the right segment of your audience.

**Content and partnerships**: In the Top **Categories tab** you will see the pages your target audience follows.  You can create content around these topics or form partnerships with people and/or brands in your niche.

The Audience Insights is a great, data-based tool that helps you confidently inform everything from your ad and targeting strategy to the content and the partnerships you can form. "

I've tried to find if I made any errors, any mistakes, and I can't seem to ascertain the problem. It's hard to believe that I'm maxing out the ad inventory at this kind of pace, but that's the only reason I can think of.

The ad sets are specific to certain locations, and time, but it includes major cities so I can't imagine that's limiting the ad inventory, either.

type, medium and partner are just element attributes I made up and set up in Tag Manager as custom variables.It will then pair them to an appropriate event tag to corresponding event category, action and label.

I however have also links with onclick, such as

&lt;div onclick=""window.location='/url/'"" type=""asdfg"" medium=""adwords"" partner=""somename""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;      


Question is, does adding custom attributes such as type, medium, partner work here in this case too and will it achieve the exact same effect as above? Or does the above only for for normal links with a href?

If it's the latter, and it does not work that way, then what would be the correct Tag Manager settings so that it achieves the same effect as in the first example for the normal a href links?

He reached out to us a couple of months ago to run AdWords in a sort of last-ditch attempt to turn things around, after having very poor sales numbers all spring. He can't really keep competitive pricing with all the big brands and outlets so conversion rate is rather poor, even for shopping. His website is of relatively low quality compared to the competition.

My instincts compel me to run with the few products that do sell relatively well, thus keeping his budget low and his ROI high. But that obviously won't be enough to save his business. He needs to increase his overall revenue by quite a bit.

Have you ever been in a situation like this, and what did you do? I'm thinking his only chance to stay afloat might be to completely redo his business model and find his own niche, so a unique assortment of wares and specialist knowledge might counteract his inability to lower prices.

* Are there other tools out there that does the same thing (helps you get FB api) but at a lower cost than Adstage?
* Someone mentioned on Reddit that Adstage has their own ""proprietary conversion tracking pixel."" What is this and what does it do?
* Some Redditor mentioned other tools track a customer's ""cross-channel customer journey."" What is the best tool that does this? Is this essential for planning retargeting campaigns?

762,"Creating an ad everyday vs scheduling a multi day ad?Hey everyone, so i've been entering the world of PPC and noticed something strage on my Facebook Ads. When I setup a one day ad, it will eat up my money hapilly.

763,"What should boutique Facebook agency charge for $400,000 ad spend client?I've heard a wide range of prices. Some quotes we've heard include:

* $10,000 flat
* 3% and bonus for performance based.
* 1%s and $5000 flat
* 13.5% but money back guarantee
* 7%

What should a firm of 2-10 people charge a client with that kind of budget for Facebook Advertising?

*edited to add*: It's a performance marketing kind of account so ROI and KPI will be watched closely. Probably needs 1-2 hour checkin with client twice a week. Plus 2 hour a day from the firm to watch account and spot problems. Maybe 15 hours initially to create creatives and do some basic product research."

My team and I just discover Instant Article - apparently it could be the next big thing on Facebook, and I have some questions that I hope you guys could help me with:

- So, Facebook pays publishers an amount of money based on eCPM, depends on locations. Any of you guys have an idea on the specific amount?

- Instant Article, in theory, will help with minimizing loading data of the landing page, or at least that what I'm understanding. Does  this apply to the whole domain or just the page in which we insert the code?

- Finally, can we use Instant Article like a regular ad optimized for smartphones? And if we can, could you guys walk me through it how to use it as an ad, as the function has not opened for register for my country.

Thank you for your help, guys.

Okay. So is this as bad as it sounds? I just got on board as inhouse. 


The agency that does the SEO and Adwords has created both GA and adwords accounts under their domain name and then just given us an email address (@agencyDomain) to log into.


As I understand it. There is no way to transfer the data to different (our) account domain name. For now the plan is just to create duplicate tracking for GA for the website. Duplicate tracking shouldn't be an issue. Right?


This combined with the fact that apparently there hasn't been any input from the agency about landing pages (there is none) and the search ad copy is as short as possible without any extensions. Doesn't raise much confidence in them.

780,"How to structure AdWords Display campaignsHello PPCers,

I've been pondering how to best structure Display campaigns and thought I'd ask here to get some more ideas.

Right now I've done it so that any sort of remarketing (any previous interaction with the site) is in one campaign with multiple audiences and an ad set in it's own ad group. So an example would be:

Campaign: Remarketing Campaign 2018

Ad Group 1: May Offer - The audience would be ""All Users"" and ""All Converters"" with their own adjusted bid

Ad Group 2: June Offer - Same audience as above

Ad Group 3: July Offer - Same audience as above

etc.

There would be only 1 ad group running at any particular time.

But when it comes to expanding out that to try acquire new customers I'm not 100% sure if the same sort of structure is correct. How I've done it before is something like this:

Campaign: Expand Targeting

Ad Group 1: Keywords + Topics

Ad Group 2: Similar To All Users

Ad Group 3: Custom Intent

Ad Group 4: Affinity + Keywords + Similar Audiences

etc.

Where all ad groups are running at the same time with the same ads but only 1 targeting method per ad group.

Does the above structure look alright? The reason why they are grouped up into 1 campaign is so that the Google system can eventually favour the best performing ad group/audience like the remarketing but I do also fear it might just favour the one with the highest click rate and not conversions.

Also if I were to put all targeting methods into 1 campaign that would allow me to generate enough conversion data to eventually use an automated bidding strategy, which is what I've done for remarketing campaigns.

Any help or personal insight would be greatly appreciated as I can't find a lot of literature on this online. Thanks.

For example, if a user clicks through an ad on the Monday and converts on the Thursday, AdWords would report the conversion as happening on Monday, whereas Doubleclick would report it as taking place on Thursday.

Really would make sense to present conversion data this way, particularly for things like day parting analysis.

  
I suppose I could do this by pulling a raw conversion report from DS and pivoting it with the engine data (using the 'conversion visit date' column rather than the 'conversion date' column) but that's a lot of messing around for analysis I like to run quite frequently.

Is there any way of setting this up in the DS interface? Is my logic missing something here as well?

My question: How do I sort of become an ""advertising consultant""? I'm planning on setting up fb ads for local businesses, for a fee of course. 

The thing is, I really don't know if I know enough. I mean, I do decently on my eCommerce ads. But I'm not completely sure if I have enough knowledge for people to actually pay me.

Also, pricing. I have zero idea on pricing. Do I get paid in one go? Daily? Weekly? Also taking note that I live in a 3rd world country, so pricing will be significantly lower compared to prices in the US.

Can people in this profession shed some light on this?

1. if you're targeting In Market Audiences can the person come to your site from a random not related site?

Does it mean even though they aren't currently searching for investment related services it means at one time recently they where? So that would explain why they are coming in from non related websites?
2. In one Ad group I have Audience defined, Keywords and Demographics. I got 0 traffic and clicks for Keywords but got views and traffic from demographic only, I selected age groups etc. Does that mean Google just showed my ad to a un targeted audience of people in those age groups and ignored my other targeting?
3. Can you have one targeting option per ad group and campaign? For instance can I just have keywords for an ad group and no other targeting selected and still get traffic?
4. How do we change your active ad group from automatic to manual targeting? "

855,"Quality of lead vs Cost of leadMy client just updated their lead form, insurance vertical, adding more than a dozen fields.  And the conversion rate has tanked, from 33% on the old form to less than 9% on the new form.  Their reasoning was that they weren't getting quality leads, but the fields they've added are not on any of our major competitor lead-forms.  We've gone from asking prospects about the make,model and year of their vehicle along with some contact info, now we're asking about all of their accident history, current coverage, and other factors.  All the new questions have added a whole page to the multi-step form (with conditional logic up to two new pages).    
In my opinion, asking these questions doesn't create quality, it merely qualifies better; and because it better qualifies it has a higher abandon rate ( and thus higher CPL).  It makes the agent's job easier, but could it really be worth it to save the agent some time by asking these questions right at the outset? It has moved our cost per lead by over $200, and it saves maybe 5 minutes on the phone with an agent.  
The most frustrating aspect is that the client is dragging their feet on purchasing an automated quoting tool, so that we can actually serve up quotes instantly.  So we're adding all of these fields that are required to make a quote, but we're not actually providing one instantly.  The lead ultimately has to speak to an agent anyway!  
My final frustration is that I don't believe their sales team is following up on leads as well as they should.  Apparently, they are closing less than 20% of leads that come in from the web.  I've done sales and I wouldn't last if that was my close rate from warm leads.  I've told them that their sales people are probably being lazy following up on online leads, because the sales people can easily make their commissions on policy renewals.  So, I suggested he has a dedicated online sales team, or someone who is actually incentivized to nurture web leads.  
Anyway, really frustrating project.  Client seems to think I can lower his marketing costs, even as he raises obstacles and expectations. Thank goodness this is all outlined in the contract.  
Anyone dealt with a client that does it all to do anything except lower their costs?"

Whenever we make a sale through PLA and I check the search query, it's always something that we rank #1-2 organically. If it's not the product then it's a youtube installation video about it or a forum post about it.

I'm convinced that the PLA's do more good than harm, but I'm trying to find a good arguement why it's beneficial if we already rank in the top and would get clicked on anyway.

I know there's the method of pausing the campaign and observing the difference in traffic/sales, but the products we sell are very high-end and we only sell a small amount per day, meaning it would be hard to statistically prove anything.

862,"Facebook conversion goal (scaling from ViewContent)Need some help with FB/IG conversion campaign

&amp;nbsp;

I'm having problems trying to use the conversion campaign when switching from ViewContent to AddToCart. 

&amp;nbsp;


Here are our events from last week in numbers (from our webpage):
ViewContent 5k
AddToCart 103
Initiate Checkout 68
Purchase 5

&amp;nbsp;

**BACKGROUND INFO**
We are a Small Boutique Brand with our own products (designed and produced) - advertising Interior Design products from linen/cotton bedding for babies to adults (price range 15€ to 200€) to wooden toys for kids (price range 30€ to 270€) selling worldwide.

&amp;nbsp;

**FB SETUP**
As we don't have enough Purchase events for our data set, I set up ViewContent as an Ad Set goal. I ran the set 3-4 days and it was having 30+ events (ViewContent) per day. The set has 2 ads, one image ad (with canvas for mobile) with the score of 9; the other is a slider (with canvas for mobile) with the score of 7. The budget was set to 5€ per day. During these 3-4 days there were 3 AddToCart Events and 2 Purchases.

&amp;nbsp;

**ADDITIONAL QUESTION**
Both ads in the Ad Set above are showing the same category (toys) of products (our best sellers, basically). The rest of the product categories I'll add into this Ad Set once I can make these ones work. Here I would like to know if it is better to mix ads for different products (in different categories) in the same ad set or to separate them by campaigns and run them at different times for the same audience or for different audiences?

&amp;nbsp;

**AUDIENCE**
This Ad Set is targeting our warm audience – Instagram engaged (90 days) and website visitors with more than 2 visits (excluding AddToCart and Purchase) in countries where most of our customers come from (parts of west EU, USA, Canada, AU and Japan) – the audience should be around 50-60k in size. Most of the audience comes from Instagram, where we have 94k followers. 

&amp;nbsp;

**TRYING TO SCALE**
I then changed the budget to 6€ and that put the ad set to learning mode ... so I changed the conversion event as well and set it to AddToCart. 30h later, I have 15 ViewContent and no AddToCart.

&amp;nbsp;

**QUESTION**
Is it time to switch back to ViewContent? … am I missing something? I had AddToCart and Purchase conversion goals set up earlier and never had real success – maybe I stopped it too early, I don't know anymore – how long do you let Conversion Campaigns last if they do not bring enough Events?

&amp;nbsp;

**ADDITIONAL QUESTION**
In addition, I used to target Hot Audience - people who added products to cart - with more “generic brand ads” that had a huge frequency (above 20) and produced just a couple of conversions per month (mostly view through purchases and not click). Now I've switched to Dynamic re-marketing and I do see some AddToCart, even Initiate Checkout, but I'm 3 weeks in and still no conversion. 

&amp;nbsp;

We don't offer any special incentive to get them back, though, and ads in general are more descriptive and not sales oriented (brand strategy). Our biggest emphasis is on really good looking lifestyle photos of products – since everything is catering to the design aspect. 

&amp;nbsp;

In a bit of a quandary here at work.  We have a educational SaaS product that's we sell a membership for, that does does very well in the US.  In 2014, we localized it to a few English speaking countries, like the UK and Australia, which wasn't too bad since English is English most everyone.  We run ads in all these areas using Adwords.  All these English-speaking countries perform about on par with each other.

We recently took the next step and localized our site content to some non-English speaking languages, like German, Spanish, and French.  We had our keywords and ad text from our Adwords campaigns translated by professional translators.  We launched these campaigns with some expectations that our CPAs would be in range with what we're seeing now, and unfortunately that hasn't been the case.

Our ad CTRs are very similar to their US counterparts, but we're seeing much lower CPCs and super low conversion rates, which makes me think we're not getting the same quality of traffic from these campaigns that we are from our ones in the US.

Looking for anyone that has advice or has tackled this kind of thing before?  Managing campaigns in languages I don't speak has been interesting to say the least...

Ideas I have so far:

* Target people on Facebook who are looking to travel to the city in which the conference takes place and have matching interests to the conference
* Using Linkedin to target people in similar groups to the conference and who are in the city
* Using Twitter to target anyone who tweets using the hashtag for the event, the problem being it is not very active

888,"odd ATC ratio FB ads...Hello!

Running a physical product ads in FB.

Click through is great -- engagement on landing page looks really good-- people are clicking through to products, adding a variety of products to cart  -- engagement on post shows a lot of interest too.

Only issue is, my add to cart metric is really out of wack. By no means am I trying to blame the issues on anything external, I understand this could have everything to do with the product/price/trustworthiness etc.

Right now about 2.5% of people that clicked the add to cart button have physically clicked to the next 'reached checkout' portion. 

What could be causing people to add to cart with no intention of moving forward at that high of a rate? Could it be quality of traffic?

Using a Lookalike audience (view content) from an earlier run at the same product. 

In the past I also had some odd cart activity where I was getting abandon carts with google's address or like a generic NYC address and generic names?

Again, not trying to blame this one something external. Would actually prefer it to be my site/product so I had something to work of off.

Any shared experience with these issues would be awesome. Thanks!"

I'm targeting long tail keyword with apparently good intent. Would you keep pushing this campaign? Because I watched the course on Udemy by Isaac Rudansky (watched all the lessons without skipping one) and I remember he said I should start worrying about my campaign after I get 100-250 clicks and 1000-1500  impressions... So now that I reach these number I'm worried... Should I be less strict because I'm an high ticket item store?"

The math just doesn't add up.

**Example:**

* $15 per Click for **100 Clicks** = $1500
* If 10&amp;#37; of those Clicks decide to try the product = **10 Registrations**
* If 10&amp;#37; of those Registrations decide to Pay = 10&amp;#37; = 1 Client = $50/month or $600/year

Hence, they will need \~3 Years to recover what it cost to get that single client!? How can they afford such a high bid? Are they purposefully losing money just to stay relevant and balancing their CAC across other channels?

940,"The 5 Types of Clients - Which Are YOU Attracting?Had a friend who got threatened with a lawsuit if he didn't give a client a refund by Friday.

She was a new agency client for just 2 days.

What most people don't realize is that there are actually 5 types of clients.

And they are NOT all created equal... far from it actually.

And the funnels that attract them all are uniquely different.

If you are an agency owner, coach, consultant, or expert, you might want to pay attention.

The moral of the story: Which types of clients are YOU attracting?

Are you attracting the highest value, easiest to work with clients? Or are you going after pain in the ass high maintenance low results clients?

Because to experience massive success, WHO you attract matters a great deal.

Here are the 5 types of clients.

Low paying clients

Will drive you crazy. Ask the world and willing to pay for none of it. When it doesn’t work, they will blame you. Unwilling to spend. High maintenance. If you are attached to the results, most of them will not succeed and you will feel guilty. High refund rates. Jump from shiny object to shiny object.

Recurring payment clients

At Traffic And Conversion, Ryan Deiss told a great story about how he got recurring clients in the Forex niche. He gave his affiliates 100&amp;#37; of the commission for a front end sale. The catch? He gave those customers a free one month trial of his private recurring membership site. Why? Because recurring clients are better than single sale clients.

High paying clients

Easy going. Ask for very little and do so humbly. Accept responsibility for their own results. Will succeed with or without you. Your goal is to guide them there faster, better, and with less mistakes.

Recurring high paying clients

Results matter the most. The faster and more consistently you can deliver exceptional results, the longer you will keep them.

Lifetime recurring high paying clients

Feel more like friends with money. You will have personal relationships and business relationships blended together. They will work with you for life, more based on who you are. There is no magic formula to get them, though this helps. Treat all your clients like they fall in this category from the very start. Some of them will. Jay Abraham calls this ""the strategy of preeminence"". Be their ""most trusted adviser for life"".

Here's the moral of the story. You need a lot less better clients to experience massive success.

Here's the kicker. The bulk of the competition is at the low end of the spectrum.

May the force be with you."
941,"Question about Goolge Shopping Feed and GTINs confusionI work with an online shop which sells products without brand name, gtin or any form of indenitifer on the product or package.

Basically, private label, but our products have no tags at all.

Part of them are rest pieces from famous companies (but we are not allowed to advertise from which company there once where.

With some other products we might be able to get GTINs from the manufacturer, but we wouldn’t want to compete for the same listing, because we are selling in a higher priced category than the competition.

Usually we are the only seller for these items in our country

What would be the best course of action here?

Use company name as brand and our own number as MPN for all products?

Is there any upside in getting our own GTINs?

Should we acquire the GTINs from manufacturers, if we are the only one selling them, because this will improve our listings?"
942,"Tips for local SEM?Hey everyone, I'm a fairly experienced SEM manager working in-house at a national retailer but recently started managing a small campaign for my friend's coffee shop. Right now everything is going great - we have the location targeting and keywords dialed in super well and we're driving good traffic to the website and shop. Here's my only hangup - right now our ads primarily show with the call extension, but I'm seeing a significantly better CTR when it shows with the location extension. On top of that, as a user I'd rather see the address than the phone number. How can I get the location extension to show more often? Our targeting is set to ""people in my location"" with a radius of 3 miles, so I don't think that's the problem. Also, any other tips you have regarding local SEM that I might not have learned working on a national account would be awesome.  "

954,"Managing Expectations (A Short PPC Working Rant in B Minor)Hi folks, 

How do you guys manage expectations of your clients? Do you have any that are too close? 

Here goes... *deep breath*

I have five years experience working agency side in what feels like every niche of digital marketing. Sort of. Mostly I've been in SEO but I've done lots of PPC management, content marketing, outreach, bits of PR etc etc. I went in-house last year at a start up who were releasing some business software. 

The directors are SO close to it, and despite admitting they have little to no idea about digital marketing and zero experience, refuse to listen to the plans and ideas of the three digital marketing execs they hired. 

There's a LOT more to this story prior to now but where we are today is: we have launched a PPC campaign looking for conversions to get people to sign up to a free trial of our software. We are currently four days in and every aspect of our PPC data is being excruciatingly analysed by the dirs, changes are being made to bids, ads and budgets all the time. We are NOT getting the conversions. 

I cannot get them to wait until we have more data before we make these sweeping changes and declarations of defeat. I can't get them to understand that it needs time and activity to become a legitimate prospect for Google (brand new site, domain, Adwords account, campaigns etc.)

To the extent that I'm questioning myself. We are getting good impressions (enormous impression share) and click through. We have strong negative keyword list and our ads are relevant and well worded. So SHOULD it be performing better by now? Am I going mad?

Landing page needs improving but I'm locked out of editing capabilities on that front so. Same goes for user journey to the free sign up. Though it does appear to be solid for me. 

Anyway. This was more of a rant about work - but the question stands; do you have any clients or bosses that you feel are too close to the nitty gritty details of their Adwords/PPC accounts that stops you from being able to properly manage it?

955,"I'm building a simple AdWords bidding tool. Could I have your feedback on the tool?Hey there. I was talking to my in\-house PPC guy the other day and someone else on the /bigSEO slack channel about a problem they were facing everyday. This got me thinking and since I'm a developer I thought I'd like to have a crack at it. Have a look at what I'm trying to solve below.

*To be able to have keywords bid automatically adjust to the ""Top of Page"" bid if in\-between a certain price range. If it is under that ""Top Of Page"" bid then it would adjust to the ""First Page Bid"" estimated by Google given a specific price range. If under that it defaults to the ""Max CPC"" value on your budget.*

964,"I'm not earning money with adwords... please, fix my logic!I know many people are earning good money with adwords. But I don't understand how. I'm fairly new on adwords campaigns. My first 4 campaigns all ended with 0 sales. 

I'm only talking about the last campaign here that is failing. After the last failed campaigns I choose to increase the profit margin I get on every sale so that I'm able to spend more money on adwords. So I've built an high ticket item store where I earn 150$ of net profit from each item sold.

But as you know, usually an ecommerce store has the conversion rate around 1&amp;#37;. This mean on average I'm going to get 1 sale every 100 people that visit my store.

On Google Keyword planner I choose keywords where the max cost per click was 0.4$. With a 200$ of daily budget, this mean= 200/0.4=500 clicks every day, so as I said previously If I have a traditional 1&amp;#37; of conversion on my store I should have 5 sales every day. 150\*5=750$ of profit every day. 

750 \- 200(my daily budget on adwords)= 550$ of daily net profit.

The problem is... this never happen. Not this time, not all the last 4 failed campaigns. After the first 12 hours I'm running my adwords campaign, the cost per click is way higher than the one I read on Keyword planner and is set to 1.5$ per click. This mean I would get 133 of daily clicks, I will get only 1 conversion and I'm losing money here.

I thought the problem may be with the quality score so I took a look there. I get a 5/10 score. I'm getting Average, Above Average and Below Average on landing page. The problem is I have not idea why I'm getting such a low score on landing page. The keyword I target on Adwords do appear on my page H1, do appear on my page URL, do appear on my page, do appear on my page title. The load speed is tuned by Shopify and is about 1.5 s. The visitors I get from adwords during the last 12 hours are enjoying my store, the bounce rate is 34&amp;#37; which it's pretty nice I think, and the average of time spent on my store is about 1 minute. I've also shared my situation on another forum asking for help and a guy told me that many people are having the ""Below average"" landing page issue lately because \- he said \- google is in need of money... But I don't know if this is true? 

Anyway I tried to share as manydetails as I could... is there a bug with my logic or what? Am I doing some wrong calculation? How to fix my problem, please?"

966,"How To Separate Conversion Reporting In Adwords?Hi PPC redditors! First time PPC poster here, I'm glad to be part of such an awesome community. 

I'm running a campaign for a productized service, there is a multi-step lead capture form and the final page is pricing with 'buy now' buttons. 

Because of this structure there are 3 distinct conversions. Contact Info submission, project info submission and an actual transaction. 

is there a way to set up individual columns for each conversion and obtain cost per step data? Is this only possible by importing google analytics data to a custom adwords report? Or is there another way?

This is an example of how I would like to structure the columns for each conversion type:

Number of Conversions | Conversion Rate | Cost Per Conversion 

I think this would be useful to analyze the cost effectiveness of the ads, targeting and keywords in relation to the number of conversions. 

Any and all advice is very much appreciated!

991,"QUESTION. FB advertising - Does the money I spend to advertise things on mobile or on computer reach the same number of people?Let's say that $3,00 would generate 100 views to my advert.  And that most of my audience uses mobile and not computers.

If I direct this advert for mobile only, do I reach 100 views?
If I direct the ads for computer only, do I also get 100 views or do I get less views, because most of my audience is on mobile?"
992,"facebook targeting removedOK so everything was working properly as of yesterday but today I come in and 95&amp;#37; of targeting options are excluded...

The warning message by Facebook is quite out of date (plus never seen this before and I log in most weekdays) and also while I know they're removing 3rd party data can't imagine that they got rid of almost all targeting options like this?

Anyone else seeing similar?

994,"[Question] Google Shopping: Setting Rules for FeedsHi all,

TL;DR: setting a 'find and replace' rule for the gtin attribute on Merchant Center feeds leads to the products getting flagged for disapproval, despite the new gtin being a valid value.

I've run into a problem with our e-comm client. They use an app called ""Adwords Robot"" to automatically create a feed for Merchant Center and by extension Adwords Shopping. 

Now, I've been getting tossed a yellow flag that I'm using restricted GTINs; which upon further inspection, is true. There are over 300 products whose GTINs start with 2. So, I face the problem of having to wipe out that leading 2 for all 300 of these products. 

I figured I have two solutions. Download the .txt file that the Adwords robot creates and do a 'find and replace'. This wouldn't work because the file gets refreshed every day. The other one is creating a rule for the Feed in Merchant Center to 'find and replace' the leading 2 and leaving the remaining numbers to give me the 12-value GTIN. But, I tried this method and it led to something weird. The 'find and replace' was able to remove the leading 2 and create a valid GTIN value, but the test said those products would be disapproved. 

Has anyone had experience with this problem? Or does anyone have any input on what I may be doing wrong with my approach?

Thanks in advance."

I think most of our content could use an optimization from a tool like this, but unsure we'd need it on an ongoing basis.  Are there people or agencies out there that pay for a tool like this, but can provide its data at a lower cost and run it against our site and provide an audit every quarter or year?

Our basic use case for it would be to optimize titles, meta descriptions, and text on our pages to try to rank slightly better.  We have several international editions that their tool could optimize as well which would be very helpful."

2,"New to SEO, need some direction as this is information overloadI was just named the SEO position at a small ""startup"" web design/film production company that was kinda just aimlessly posting stuff to the internet. Nobody was doing it, and it was kinda thrown into my lap, I dont have experience with this. Im working with the marketing person here and have google analytics, hootsuite, coscheduler, hubspot info to help go forward with our wordpress site. I know some of that isnt directly SEO related, but I need to merge that together.   


So I guess with all the info at hand, where do I start? I feel like this is an overwhelming amount of info and I need to condense it. The design and dev lead are already doing the basics within wordpress, but I guess I need to learn or figure out how i merge all this together? I don't even know exactly. I've looked at a couple tutorials, yoast which from reading some other posts here, is apparently garbage, and another moz article as well. It seems like I have nearly limitless way to go about things, i need some focus and dont know where to start.  


I was told, our site comes up on google organically on page 3, we want to bump that to page 1 if possible, or at least see movement to page 2. "
3,"Question about YoastSo, I just got off the phone with the guys that built our website. In fact it was the founder of the company I just spoke with, they are a web dev and marketing agency. We only needed Web Dev and no SEO, as that is what I do. Some of our pages need to be re-written due to duplicate content (long story and irrelevant to my point) and one of the points that I told this guy was that I wanted the pages written to Yoasts ""good"" standard (readability only).
He then went on to tell me that Yoast isn't very accurate and is used best as a rough guide only. I mentioned ""do you mean things like keywords in the first line not being detected because theres code before it"" he said ""yes, but other reasons also"" He went on to say that all you really need are your good headlines, rich snippet, some content that is readable and a few keywords dotted around the content and you'll be fine. He told me as long as you have that, the main essence of SEO comes from the off-page SEO.

I think Yoast is pretty good and looking at SEO holistically you want on page SEO to be good to create a better UX which in turn will help you rank higher. So it would be in your best interest to try and satisfy Yoast as much as possible.

My question to you all is what does Reddit think about this, is this guy right? He runs the agency which has been going for over 5 years so they must be doing something right."
4,"Medic AlgorithmHi All,

I noticed my site sinking in the organic results from the top of page 2/bottom of pg 1 to now the bottom of page 4 for the search term ""personal trainer Austin"". My site is https://www.completefitnessdesign.com

Nothing has been done to my site other than the usual bi weekly blog being published, which has been happening for years and years, so I figure it's got to be the August initiated Google Medic algorithm that's getting me, as that's when I noticed the start of the decline. Thankfully, my local is still atop the pile. I realize that it's aimed at health, fitness, and wellness sites, and that those who either sell products (I don't) that may be deemed suspicious, such as supplements, etc, are penalized. Others who may engage in riskier practices can be penalized without a certain level of backlinks, reviews, or other proofs of trust. As a personal trainer of over 20 years, I work on a myriad of complex issues such as ankylosing spondylitis, rehab for all joint issues, geriatric, etc, etc, etc. I train doctors, pro athletes, etc. Yes, I realize I break free of the stereotype of the job due to the complexity of my services, but is that alone enough reason to fall to the bottom of P4? Any ideas on how to bob back up to the surface over the next few months? With New Years coming in a few months, I'd like to regain my foothold on P1 or 2.

Thanks in advance for your help.

But I was even more surprised when by visiting this website, I ended up on our own website because there is an immediate redirect.

My client is in no way related to this industry. And I can't imagine why some webmaster would do such a redirect. Is it even potentially harmful for us?  


UPD:  My bad, I confused the terms and misinformed everybody.   
**Here is what actually happens:** Instead of having a redirect to our website, it actually shows the content of our website while having that ""adult-themed"" url address.

After some dodgy deals with Instagram “influencers”, (which many I discovered have jut paid for fake followers in order to scam people looking to promote their brands out of their money). I began to pull my money and promotion deals from Instagram and put it more into Facebook.

I'm not the expert that a lot of others are, but I have been doing this for a while with broad experience across verticals for small and large sites. 

I'm trying to figure out how to fix this issue. I'm doing it for a friend and as you know no good deed goes unpunished. 

The question is: what should I try or look for to fix this?

Details:

Company name is the keyword target. Basically the company name would be similar in structure like a hypothetical example of ""Chicago Orthopedics"" 

The domain is the company name. It has existed for 10 years. 

Call to action link above in slider goes to the contact page. 

Home page has unique intro text about 400 char that works well in the design. It mentions the company name twice and the location 1 additional time. H1 is primary keyword.

Other text on the home page include navigation at the top to:  
\- services, about, contact &amp; link to sister site

\- list of services in grid, with link from each service to the service page. Some use the natural variation of the keyword without the location since it is relevant, others don't. ex: Physical Therapy or whatever. Nothing looks spammy and they link to 1 services page which lists the services so there isn't a bunch of thin ""Chicago X"" type of pages. Just 1 page that lists the services. 

About page has more text naturally. About 1800 char. H1 is ""About Us"" H2 is ""Meet Our Team"" and another H2 with no keywords. It basically mentions the company name (that keyword, linked to the home page which I added recently to try and steer some relevance to the primary page) in some intro text and has bios for the company's employees. It mentions the service version of the keyword without location (Ex: Orthopedics) in some of the bios.

Meta descriptions are appropriate, not keyword stuffed, etc. 

I have tried a bunch of stuff to get the home page to rank instead of the about page, including: 

1. Changed the about page URL &amp; content, 301 old one to home page.
2. Added (currently there) Canonical tag on about page pointing to homepage
3. Added (currently there) link from the about page to the home page with the keyword term which is also the company name.  

Nothing seemed to make any difference. The new about page URL outranks the home page. 

There are no manual actions, the site is indexed fine, and a keyword search with site operator shows the home page first. (ex: chicago orthopedics site:chicagoorthopedics.com and orthopedics site:chicagoorthopedics.com)   
I can't find any toxic links to it. There's 1 blog where it's a blogroll link but I don't think it's a bad site. SEMrush toxic score is 38 (just one measure I know) and other sites have shown a nice boost from a link on this same blogroll. 

I mentioned a sister site. This is using the exact same design code &amp; architecture with different content. The only real difference is that it has 1 person on the about page so it is more of a personal service provider site. It is another service the owner provides. Let's say that is ""Chicago Physical Therapy"" and has a similar domain as above, chicagophysicaltherapy.com which it does. 

The sister site, which is virtually similar ranks just as desired with the home page for the single targeted term. They're cross linked from between the sites using just the service name in navigation, not location. ex: ""Physical Therapy"" from the Orthopedics site links here and ""Orthopedics"" from the PT site links to the other one. This sister site domain is 2 years old. 

Both sites have approx the same ratio of links to home page vs about or any other sub pages, and the same ratio of keyword to non-keyword terms in links.

So, I've had this blog on Google Blogger for quite some time now. Let's call it example.blogspot.com. It's indexed on Google Search, added to my Search Console account along with blogger perks like HTTPS and stuff.

Today, I bought a custom domain, say example.com, directly from Blogger's 'set up a custom domain' option using Google Domains.

The transition went fine, HTTPS was enabled, so was DNSSEC and now 

example.com redirect to https://www.example.com

www.example.com redirects to https://www.example.com

example.blogspot.com redirects to https://www.example.com

1. pick your new site from the list - already selected www.example.com

2. confirm that 301 redirects work properly - already confirmed

3. check that verification methods are still present - the website www.example.com was verified to my account using Google Domains so I 'Confirmed' this one.

4. Submit the change of address request - Submitted.


**Now, here are some of my question.**

1. Will I run into any trouble for duplicate content? All my redirects are working and the default site is 'www.example.com' permanently.
2. Do I have to set up a canonical URL? If yes, how do I do it? 
3. Do I have to request removal of the links already submitted to the Search Index (using Fetch as Google tool) or will it automatically update due to the 'Change of Address' submission.
4. If I have to submit new links from my blog to the Index, I should use the 'www.example.com' property instead of 'example.blogspot.com'. Right?

It will be great if you guys can answer thes questions. Thanks."

47,"Expired Domain Purchase - Looking for Some AdviceI spent about $600 on an expired domain that I believe was purchased from a GoDaddy auction and then transferred to my account from the broker who bought it. I did research on the domain (albeit not enough) and everything looked clean at the time. 

Now that I've gone through and connected to Webmasters I've realized that this domain was used to host some 60,000+ ebooks, all of which were probably illegal since it looks like there were a lot of school textbooks in there (all /book.pdf pages). Furthermore, it looks like a virus was once on the site (A trojan probably in the ebooks).

Despite all of this, the site is still indexed in Google and is showing as being otherwise healthy in webmasters. I'm working on disavowing some of the bad backlinks, which it doesn't look like there were many. Almost all the backlinks I checked in Majestic looked clean and relevant to the website.

Problem is Google has still crawled all of those .pdf page extensions. None appear in the search results but Google still thinks the page exists. I've gone through and submitted an updated sitemap, while all of those pages are 404'd. 

Is there anything else I should be doing to clean up this domain? "

​

Hi everyone,

​

​

A group of us have recently launched a unique subReddit and we'd like to connect with you guys as the SEO experts. Why? Well, because our sub is dedicated to a single project - **combining Reddit's vast array of talents &amp; backgrounds to build a 1 business at a time**.

​

* Together as Redditors.
* From scratch: crowdsourcing the idea...
* ...to market execution (financially backed with $100k)

​

​

Businesses start with an idea and then get talent. We're doing the opposite - looking for talent first. Then, we'll crowdsource business ideas, have a voting process, analyze its viability, delegate roles/responsibilities/titles as necessary, and of course...take it to **full market execution**.

​

We've talked to some prominent advisors and consultants, and we're pretty optimistic on what may become of this.

​

So we'd love if we could have some of you guys join us to help us mold what our community will become.

​

​

​

Our sub is /TheBusinessGroup: [https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBusinessGroup/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBusinessGroup/)

​

​

We hope to see some of you there :)

I don't have much experience in SEO (yet) and have a quick question:

A friend of mine hired a local SEO agency to boost her ranking, which worked rather well so far. I've seen, that they put the following links to their own website on the about-page of my friend's site (i changed their domain to ""seo-agency-website"" in the following snippet):

    &lt;a href=""http://seo-agency-website/seo-search-engine-optimization/""&gt;SEO / Search Engine Optimization&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href=""http://seo-agency-website/""&gt;Online Marketing&lt;/a&gt;

While i'd find it absolutely OK to put a (single) backlink to their own site on the sites of their client, i find these links a bit shady. To me this looks, that the SEO agency is using their client's site to boost their own ranking with the linked keywords. Furthermore this smells a lot like ranking-manipulation to me - and probably also Google. Might this even result in Google penalizing my friend's website?

Or am i completely wrong with this assassment and this is a common and valid practice?

100,"Here is how I've scaled my guest posting by 3X in less than few hours.Well, being in this industry for more than 6 years, I've tried multiple ways for guest post link building and some of them being:

1. Outreach via their contact form/email.
2. Few hacky ways like infographic submission or scholarship link building (which seems to be totally useless now)
3. Finding brokers and dealing with them for guest post links in bulk

And here are few things why it sucked always:

* These brokers deliver really shitty links and it becomes difficult few times to remove such links.
* Negotiation time is too much. Discovering new blogs is such a pain in the ass.

So I've built a product (thanks to WordPress API's) which allows anyone to post any article on WordPress enabled blog in few seconds. All you have to do is:

1. Go on [https://pressly.me](https://pressly.me)
2. Signup and compose your first guest post (You can add links, medias and whatever you want)
3. Select blogs where you want to publish this piece of content
4. Pay and hit ""Publish"" and your guest post is live instantly.

Here is how it works in the backend:

* Bloggers who want to monetize their blogs are partnered with Pressly and they have setup a fixed cost for guest post.
* Since they have enabled their Wp APIs and created user for Pressly, getting post published takes literally 3 second.

It's just the first week of this product and I have managed to partner with 50+ websites (mostly they are in tech/crypto niche) but its growing like crazy.

Do check out Pressly and share your experience of doing guest/sponsored post submission with them. I'm 200% sure that you'll be surprised after using this product for guest posting.

PS: If you are a blogger, you can get partnered with Pressly.me by contacting them on prateek@pressly.me

I have taken a lot of photos for local businesses here in NYC and New Jersey. My standard practice is to just pass images over to them so they can choose how they want to 'represent' themselves via photography.

1. Should I be uploading the images myself to their business page and taging myself? Obviously it will be good if other business see that I took it, but more importantly, does that do anything for SEO ranking? I have a pano I took for a local coffee shop and it's got 50k hits so far. It needs to be updated as well, so I'm curious about how important that link is, especially if we take it down and redo it.

2. What is the best approach to expressing to clients that I shoot in NYC all the time without painting it in big bold letters in my business name like, Darren Phillip Jones Photography, Yes... YES I shoot in NYC. Please don't ignore me because my address says NJ. My friend rents in Hell's Kitchen, and said I could use his address, but I don't know how reliable that is since he just rents there.

3. Does it help to photograph local attractions and tag my business? I'm trying to figure out how to increase my rankings outside of hoping a big agency picks me up and remembers to tag my site. That's actually a big issue for me as well. I have been published in some crazy big magazines, high traffic sites... but article writers always 'forget' to credit me and back link to my site. And I am lucky if I find one of my photos used without tagging. Tracking all of my images would be a nightmare.

4. Do any of you know of a decent service that tracks photos that doesn't cost a fortune? And a good practice with it? I know of 1-2 services, but they are pricey, and not reliable. Especially since people resize everything, it doesn't always catch. I even found one of my photos in the wild, and exported to the same size, and it still didn't catch it.

I did google 'Photographer SEO' to see what comes up, but a lot of it was super basic info, like making sure to blog and tag photos! And include photographer in your keywords!

If you have any tips or advice, I'm all ears! And if you're in the NYC area and would like to possibly trade services, let me know.

The thing is - most of the client accounts I was on (fortune 500 clients) - they didn't even implement my recommendations.

Maybe a year or so ago, we added Yoast SEO to our website. Sometimes we post duplicate content across domains and canonicalize it to whatever the page we want to rank. In most cases this is put on our All in One SEO plugin that we installed years ago.

I just discovered that both All in One SEO plugin and the Yoast plugin automatically ship a default canonicalization url of the current page. So many legacy pieces that we put a custom canon. URL on are now displaying conflicting canon. URLs to Google, since the AIO plugin shows the custom one, whereas Yoast shows the default.

125,"Google Indexing Page's previous URLHi,

This is quite a mess, a confusing tale I tell.

In mid to late July, I changed the url of a page to something very similar (for SEO purposes) and set up a 301 redirect from the previous URL to the new one. 

Within the last couple of weeks, I noticed that the page has completely fallen out of the rankings altogether. When I Google searched for the new URL, the top listing was the old URL, but the exact new URL is not to be found. The page was last indexed early July, before I changed the URL.

I looked in my .htaccess and remembered that at some point in the past I had used the new URL for an old version of the site, and that redirect was still in my .htaccess file. So, I had a looping problem: URL A redirects to URL B redirects to URL A. I quickly deleted the original redirect, leaving only URL B redirecting to URL A.

I then used Google Search Console's Index Coverage tool and discovered that the new URL is Excluded, type: ""Page with Redirect"". I inspected that page using the same tool and discovered that the User-directed canonical and the google-declared canonical are the same, the old URL.

Is this purely a redirect issue that will resolve if I request a new crawl from Google? If so, is there a drawback to doing that?

Or have my mistakes caused a huge canonical mess? If so, how do i resolve it?

Thanks very much!

127,"International URL structure QuestionHello Reddit,

I have an on page SEO question that’s been bugging me and I do hope you’ll be able to help.

&amp;#x200B;

I have an ecommerce site that sells to USA/Thailand

&amp;#x200B;

My question would be on the page structure that I would use to target these countries. Now Country TLD is not possible in my case (.uk,.vn,.th) and I am going with subfolders and I feel it helps just a little bit more than a sub domain.

​

The main business will Be targeting in the USA, with a single payment processor for all regions

​

So here is what I cannot decide on the URL structure

&amp;#x200B;

Option 1.

&amp;#x200B;

Have a landing page targeting the different countries other than USA.

eg. [abc.com/buy-item-thailand](https://abc.com/buy-item-thailand)

​

examples :

[https://www.exabytes.com/philippines-web-hosting](https://www.exabytes.com/philippines-web-hosting)

[https://www.uavsystemsinternational.com/drones-sale-thailand-buying-drones-thailand/](https://www.uavsystemsinternational.com/drones-sale-thailand-buying-drones-thailand/)

&amp;#x200B;

I will build links to these landing pages for thai rankings as I will be using the same payment processor for all countries

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Option 2

&amp;#x200B;

URL : Abc.com/th/buy-product

&amp;#x200B;

This option will be an entire separate site focused to the thai region

One benefit i think of this, is that I can have a separate blog just creating thai specific content while my main site abc.com creates US content. I would also be able to get country specific sitelinks to appear in the SERP as opposed to a landing page as well as create lots more of country specific content

​

examples :  [https://www.adidas.com/us/men-shoes](https://www.adidas.com/us/men-shoes)

​

Option 3

Abc.com/th/en-th

This is even more language and country specific but I am wondering if there are too many layers diluting my content as the product page will look something like

[Abc.com/th/en-th/buy-product](https://Abc.com/th/en-th/buy-product)

​

example :

[https://www.nike.com/th/en\_th/](https://www.nike.com/sg/en_gb/)

I'm trying my best to recover it now using different techniques and strategies and while it would be nice to do it one at a time, there's so much to do. One instance I was always #1 for certain keywords, I was proud really! But I changed the entire site's architecture and I thought 301 would pass the SERP over but I was wrong, way wrong. It's been about 8 months since I did this, is it still recoverable if I changed the URLs back to what it was? I didn't know Google cared how far away something was from the HP but yet, another mistake. Now google has thousands of 404 pages, yet they all 301 just fine on my end. Is there hope? Webmatser tools only show less than 50 query pages in the past month and before it was tens of thousands at least. Good lord, what have I done?

**EDIT 2:** I ended up doing the canonical thing and instead of using 301 redirects for everything, i permitted the page to exist with canonical to the new page.

Now Google understands how the site is structured and while not all links have returned into the top 10 listings, many have already been resolved. It's only a matter of time.  Within a few hours one of the pages that I was aiming to get listed got #5 spot. It's not #1 as it once was but it's better than being unlisted. Now I'm focusing on other SEO related techniques to boost my pages but the hard part is over. Big thanks to all your help!"

155,"Single page vs. multiple pages when there's a lot of related but distinct contentSlight titlegore, I realise! Basically I run [moviemistakes.com](https://moviemistakes.com), which lists mistakes, trivia, questions, etc., sometimes hundreds per movie/TV show. In most cases the canonical page combines all related things onto one page, ie. 280ish mistakes for Titanic all in one big list, rather than the default 20 per page if you click through within the site itself. The potential issue I have is that especially for questions relating to a specific title, if someone searches for a given term and comes to the site, what they're looking for might be entry 100, way, way down the page. It also means that some given pages are really really long, with huge amounts of text with no distinct keywords beyond the obvious ""Titanic mistakes"" or similar.

As such, might it be worth ignoring the general recommendation that single pages are preferred, and instead keep everything split up into pages of 20 (or more/less?) I don't want to feel like I'm inflating pageviews by forcing people to click through endlessly if they want to read everything, but equally if searches are taking them to massive pages full of stuff they might not have searched for. ""Titanic mistakes"" will get them where they want, but asking ""What religion were the first class passengers practicing in the church scene?"" is answered either at the top of page 6, over 100 entries down on the combined page.

But a month ago I decided to go with a custom sitemap for a site that wasn't on Wordpress. The original sitemap hadn't been updated since 2010 and was full of parameter URLs, so I used Screaming Frog to make my own sitemap that only included the URLs I wanted.

The result was astonishing. Traffic doubled literally overnight.  August had a 1,000% increase in traffic compared to June (the new sitemap was submitted in July).  I couldn't believe it.  I checked for anything else it could have possibly been. But the cause and effect was unequivocal.  I've never had one change produce such a drastic result in my years of SEO.

Now I'm going to start testing on other sites to see what the results might be.  But the experience made me curious about how other SEOs treat sitemaps on their sites.

How much time do you put into them? Do you only do automatically generated, or do you do custom builds?  What's your policy for URL inclusion?  "
164,"Wix for SEO?Hey guys, complete SEO noob right here.

Slowly learning the ropes of SEO in order to apply it to the company I work for. I'm working on raising the money in order to take the Clickminded certification to become proficient with it. 

My company is currently using Wix as the platform for their website. We own the domain so we aren't using the free version to at least seem more professional. I have used the Wix SEO options but it seems awfully short-handed.

I am in a position where I am able to transfer the website to another platform, and I will if it benefit the company in terms of SEO. Would there be much difference if I move over to Wordpress? Is it hard to learn considering I don't know any HTML?"
165,"How do you scale SEO for local small business?Quick background: I am a solopreneur running a small local business. Decent understanding of SEO and tried various strategies over the years. SEOs I talked to all say I have decent on-page, currently ranking with backlinks but I still think there's room to improve. However, I feel that I have hit a brick wall.

Looking for some suggestions on how can a solopreneur scale SEO like authority sites do?

Some concrete examples:

Guest posting: Scored some great links but diminishing return after a few articles. Focus on gaining referral domains instead but constant outreach (for new sites) takes too much time, more than writing the article itself. Also taking time away from writing for my own site.

Media outreach: Also very time consuming, success rate being low and sometimes you don't get link, or a no-follow.

Citations: Quality ones already done, ranking in 3-pack for those searching in my area. Don't need hundreds and certainly don't want spammy citations.

PBNs: Nearly all competitors in my niche are relying on PBNs more or less, mixed results. It's like a drug, the juice feels great at the beginning then you keep adding until you die from overdose. Having too many homepage PBN links is a dangerous footprint anyway?

TL;DR
Yes SEO works but everything I have done so far feels like a linear (time consuming) approach. Interested in hearing ideas on how you can go exponential, leap frogging competitors."

I have already added most of the pages from OLD SITE to NEW SITE, the other pages won't be coming over. I have setup 301 redirects on a per page level to point to the URL of the NEW SITE. I have also set a site wide NO-INDEX on the OLD SITE, and currently have the OLD SITES content NOINDEXED on the NEW SITE as well.

I just want to double check that I am handling this correctly, I have the 301 redirects on a per page basis, then I have a htaccess redirect in place as well (I'm wondering if only one of these is needed). I started a change of address to finalize everything but I wanted to make sure that I am doing everything correctly. Should the OLD SITE stay up with all its content and have a site wide no index?

Should I submit a removal of the OLD SITE or will the change of address take care of the OLD pages being in the index under the OLD domain?

172,"Local SEO when you're not located in that area?A bit of an odd question, mostly relating to Google My Business I guess. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, the question: we're a recruitment business located just outside London, but 95% of our clients are in London. How do we go about informing GMB and optimising accordingly (in addition to blog posts etc.)?

&amp;#x200B;

Additional info:

&amp;#x200B;

I've owned a recruitment business for 20 years and we've never really focussed too much on our own SEO. Mainly because the places we advertise (job boards) and our competitors have much deeper pockets and resources to invest in SEO. However, as we're about to rebrand it would make sense to at least make the logical steps. FYI this will effectively be a brand new business (from Google's perspective, and this can't change).

I explained to him how SEO actually works and all the important factors to rank for keywords and basically how quality content + links is the perfect formula. I told him to think of it as a long-term marathon, not a race. However, he gives me the same response. ""I want results now. Why do I gotta wait? I want sales now"". I wanted to help him charge an X amount for a certain period of time. But of course he gives me the same ""that's too long, i want results now"" type of response and brings up Fiverr and how the SEO services he found were much much cheaper there. i explained everything i can. the consequences his site will face when buying links and all that.

​

He completely ignores the value of SEO and only plans to stick with paying for ads. I did all the explaining I can. Weeks later, he told me he was really going to use fiverr for SEO services because the seller had many excellent 5 star reviews and said he was going to bring results in such a short time frame. This includes link services. I advised him many times not to use Fiverr but he goes on ahead to use it anyway. I hope he doesn't come crying to me when his site gets slapped with a manual penalty and destroys his website.

5. When you receive a document to edit, how do you approach the process? What are you strengths and weaknesses as an editor?

6. How do you balance independent thinking and cooperation with others? Share an example.

7. What is your experience with content strategy and SEO? How have you used these to increase the reach and impact of your content?

So how come some existing sites are significantly more popular than others?

I will try to keep on track as not to bore you. I will also try to keep companies, products and SEO companies vague as to not go against the rules.

* I have created a website for a family business. We are busy at our physical location, but wanted to try an online store. Our top selling product is X (not sure on the rules about listing products/websites)
* I've been using Neil Patel's SEO autochecker, scoring an 89. I can get this over 90 with some tweaking I'm sure.
* When compared to the top 3 websites on google selling product X, I out rank them anywhere from 3-20+ points. 
* My website is showing 0 errors and less warnings than all the other websites.
* All the other websites have more backlinks than me.
Now comes the questions.
* Out of the 3, I rank higher than 2 of them because of back links.
* I've been in contact with an SEO company that says my site is fast, and doesn't seem to be any issues, but also said there is a problem with traffic and back links.
* The said SEO company wants to charge me 500/month to up my ranking.
* SEO company also said that I should not engage with ad words as for my keyword they are $10+. I have confirmed this, as I was using adwords. SEO Company said that other companies selling the product are just outbidding each other on adwords and not optimizing their site.

Now for the questions:

1. Is NP's SEO autochecker a good site to use to get a rough estimate of where you stand in rankings?
2. In terms of SEO companies, do they ask you to make changes to your website to satisfy some SEO tests?
3. If it is against Google's terms to buy back links, how does SEO companies increase my back links if not from buying them?
4. At this point with my site ""optimized"" more than my competition, should I still hire an SEO company or is my money better going elsewhere to gain traction (ads, etc...)?


Apologies if some of these questions seem obvious. I can give more info if needed.

Thanks for reading,

Chris"

229,"Landing pages for guranteed low-volume searches, worth it?Is it worth creating landing pages for low search volume keywords? For example, an area specific campaign that may target small villages with only one or two searches each month?

Long story short I am refactoring a clients website and we employed an SEO guy to do the landing pages. We agreed 90 landing pages in total.. Admittedly some of the areas have a very low population, maybe only a few thousand people.

Half way through the project the SEO guy basically said it is not worth creating these pages for the small villages, **search volume will be slow low that we risk being penalised by Google**.... WHAT?!? Google will penalise a website simply because it contains a page that does not generate much traffic? Does this statement hold any weight?.. 

I run a company that has lots of pages without huge amounts of search volume, does this mean Google will penalise me? It sounds complete rubbish!

Surely one or two searches each month is better than nothing, thats a potential for up to 24 customers in a year... add 10 small villages thats potential for up to 240 customers.

**Thoughts?**

&amp;#x200B;

I should add that it is no work at all to add a landing page.. We created a plugin in WordPress that makes the process quick and easy using a page template with custom fields to fill in the blanks (meta, headings, images, seo content).

The SEO guy was employed to complete a minimum of 300 words per landing page and it looks he's got half way though, got bored, and fed us this rubbish to avoid doing the rest of the pages."

237,"Establishing legitimate backlink from BloglovinMy wife has a small business with a blog website that I am trying to improve the SEO visibility. I checked my wife’s website in moz open site explorer to find out that she only has one backlink. Most of her effort is put into social media, which you don’t get backlink credit for. I did the same search on moz for competitors in her field, and a lot of them are receiving credit for backlinks from Bloglovin, which my wife also post her articles on. 

Is there a trick to getting credit for a backlink from bloglovin?

I am guessing since bloglovin never leaves their url to provide the feed, that is why my wife is not getting credit for the backlink. And I am guessing that her competitor did a guest post in someone else’s blog, who is also on bloglovin, with a hyperlink to their website (so it left bloglovin’s url to go to the competitor’s website). Does that logic make sense?

Is there a legitimate way to receive a backlink from bloglovin? It sounds like google frowns on creating a bunch of backlinks by doing guest posts on someone else’s blog.  Since bloglovin has a Domain Attorney of 89 and page authority of 49, I would imagine this could help my wife's website greatly."

265,"Advertising to an inbound link on GoogleI am sorting out an issue I had earlier with keywords and titles on Google that you guys helped a lot with, but during the process of cleaning up I had an idea that I'm sure should work but I'm not sure of every step I would need to take for the process to run smoothly.

What I would like to do:

Advertise a new page on Google that contains all the same information as my product page currently does including the meta description, product images and title, but when a customer clicks on the ad they are instead redirected to my actual product page which contains a much cleaner less term heavy description. I have old URLs that we used to use for our products, and they currently just redirect to the updated product page but we do not advertise them.

Why I would like to do this:

* Title: Including key terms in a product title is necessary for visibility on most marketplaces, but on a product page I feel the title should simply be the product title and nothing else. Any key terms and information about the product should be in the description or in the images.
* Images: In a product highlight page, I do not want to be limited to square, white background images without text or backgrounds. Additionally, the images for our mobile website need to be different than the desktop version, but Google does not allow me to manually upload images to the feed that I'm aware of; having the same image twice in a different aspect would not be beneficial
* Multiple Pages: Currently Google will only allow us to advertise our product once despite their being different colors because the products all reside on the same URL, submitting the products twice violates Google's policy on duplicate listings as well as the images all being submitted on the same ad (so blue may appear as black because Google is snagging all the images on the page). If this method is viable, I would be able to feed different URLs for each of my products, and have them all redirect to the main page once the ad is clicked on.

I have researched this vehemently and cannot get a straight answer on whether this is possible, against policy or if there is an easier way. Google is strategically vague on this matter as far as policy which is no doubt to be able to take down listings as they see fit without allowing any clear workarounds. Any information or help on the matter would save me a lot of trouble."

One opinion is that they are not necessary for every page.  Especially things like FAQ pages.   Just use an H1 tag at the top of the page.  You want the stuff to load quick and get to the info.  The other side is that the image is expected and when landing on the page if there isn't one it seems something is missing.  You will wait for a second or two for it to load.  If it doesn't you then realize it.  Plus, the image immediately conveys what that page is about intuitively.

I've briefly looked on [fiverr.com](https://fiverr.com) for some freelancers to do some audits - thoughts were to pay 4 or 5 to do some basic/standard audits and go from there. Is this a waste of money? Can you recommend a better course of action and efficient use of money to spend? Being a web dev myself i can do a lot of the work that would come up.

Thanks for your help!"

284,"Does product title matter in SEO?I recently inherited the management of the website for the company I work for in an effort to boost sales on it. We do most of our business on Amazon, but the website was in poor shape visually and was difficult to navigate. I got it looking a bit better, but one problem that **really** bugs me is the product titles. We outsource an SEO specialist who has told us advertising on Google, having keywords in product titles is a necessity; but our competitors do not do this and show up in the space on google regardless. For example, if we were selling phones our product title would read ""Mobile Cellular Touch Screen Phone Rechargeable Battery Any Service Provider Android"". Our competitors use titles consisting of just their product name e.g. ""iPhone 6 plus"".

&amp;#x200B;

What I'd like to know is, what workaround can I use to cut our titles down? As a consumer myself, I would be driven away by such a desperate poke at keywords and cannot imagine our customers don't feel the same when they get to the product page.

&amp;#x200B;

Our website is hosted on Shopify, and I feel like I should be able to get all the SEO I need just from alt text and product tags. Any input would be greatly appreciated, and you'll be saving me from temporary insanity. My job is to make the website look pretty, and these product titles are a pool of vomit on my marble floor."

I am one of the key account managers for a company. This company I work for as a website , but the SEO is quite terrible. The company is a EU-Wide operating company and the website is available in different languages. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, a while back the company bought domains with the country code top-level domain for my key account relevant to the product. For example, if the company would be apple, the domains I'm  talking about would [macbook.es](https://macbook.es), [a](https://aluminumlaptop.es)pple-macbook.es, etc.

293,"Crawl budget: is it something you worry about?Hey /r/SEO folks!

I've got a question for y'all: is crawl budget something you worry about? While the majority of the SEO community think it's important for large platforms (while smaller sites benefit from applying the best practices too) Google says it's overrated, and that you don't have to worry about it ([sauce](https://www.seroundtable.com/google-crawl-budget-overrated-25825.html)).

I noticed a lot of SEOs are struggling with crawl budget, so I figured I'd write a piece on the matter.

The website is going to be a sex shop if that matters. I heard that Prestashop beats Wordpress. Is it true?

Yeah, in Wordpress you can also have a blogging category, but let's face it: blogging is not that great when you think about a sex shop. After all, how many people would share an article that was posted on a sex shop? I currently have a sex shop website using wordpress platform but for some reason it got down since the march update of Google's algorithm. I tried anything but it just doesn't want to rank better, so I am willing to start a new website to take it from scratch.

The website is going to have  an estimated several thousand products(2-3-4-5k,  maybe more maybe less, don't know for sure) that get placed there over time. Does wordpress gets slow and bulky if you have too many products? If not Wordpress or Prestashop, I am willing to learn other platforms as well, I am open to any idea. I heard about Magento being great too, but I heard that you need coding skills and I only know HTML and CSS."

302,"Getting started with SEMRush - Structure/methods for putting an SEO audit report together?I've used SEMRush briefly in the past, but now I'm using it to put together a detailed analysis for a client, including:
- Full site SEO audit
- Keyphrase analysis for terms, and comparing with competitors
- Competitor analysis

Now I spent a lot of yesterday playing around and it's great and there's a lot of data and info to go through. But now I'm trying to pull together a report and lost on where to even get started! There's plenty here but actually doing the analysis and putting together the most relevant advice is what's holding me back.

I've also seen it can do branded reports but I'm not paying for that level yet. So far, I can't see the harm in screenshotting any relevant graphs, putting it it into Word and adding commentary. After all, it's the actual analysis and advice the clients want, which may be more of a pain in a branded report. Though I can see the value for the ongoing monthly reports whereby I assume it will automatically update the data within, at which point all I have to do is add comments and export.

If anyone has any tips, advice or a structure to follow on pulling together an SEO audit that'd be great, or the most efficient/effective routine of pulling and presenting data from SEMRush. I also have Majestic and Screaming Frog. Thanks!

303,"Puppies for sale!Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

So I got hired as the SEO at this digital marketing company, it's a small one (max. 10 people). Monday was my first day here.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is I worked before (for one year and a half) in a similar company, but I only did one thing there: link building, and guest posting was the main technique.

&amp;#x200B;

For now I have to take care of a site that sells puppies. So this is kind of an online store.

After 2-3 days of talking different ideas and me trying to get something right, we kind of got to the conclusion that I should take care of guest posting (meaning what I did before coming here) for the next few days and see how I can manage that and what results I will have.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I kinda got the impression that I need fast results (meaning what fast means for SEO). So, are there any tips you could give me? What are the things I should keep in mind at all time? Are there any insightful article/s that would address this exact matter? Meaning what I should do right now to help my ecommerce site rank better now?

Are there any other techniques I should try in order to make the site rank better (for instance I thought about making a Pinterest Business account and manage that for let's say 30 minutes a day)?

I hope I was clear enough (as you guessed it, English is not my native language).

Now, I've got a few questions:

1. **Which one does Google prioritize more, product page, blog/article page, or just page with the perfect amount of semantic and LSI keywords?**
2. **With my limited time (campaign ends on December 2018), should I force to change the landing page (on-page optimization, internal linking, backlinking) to the one that I prefer?**

We are now left with a halfway built home that we can't live in and stuck living in a small apartment in the city paying rent, a mortgage, utilities, lawyer fees to fight him, etc. He's made our lives a nightmare.

There is a high demand for general contractors in our area and we want to share our story with others so they do not make the mistake that we did. I have purchased two domain names that are similar to his website name. So for example, if his website name is Carver1.com, I purchased CarverOne.com and Carver1Construction.com. 

Is this the best way to go about doing this to share our story with others who are considering using him as a contractor? We know the laws about libel and slander, and we intend to tell only the truth, so we are not worried about that. Just don't want anyone to get ripped off by this slimeball like we did.

336,"Bootstrapping a local SEM agency?I'm looking to start an agency from the ground up focusing on not just SEO, but the full SEM spectrum. I realize that it'll be a lot of work, that I don't know everything and eventually won't be able to do everything myself, but I'm interested in hearing from those that have successfully done it. 

What were your biggest challenges initially? 

How long did you go before you went full-time with it? 

What do you know now you wish you knew back then?

I realize that free-only tools won't do the job forever; What tools were worth the money to buy initially? Which were not? 

 While it's understood that offering packages is generally a no-no, what core items do you find used more often than not (content creation/optimization, link building, native/PPC, etc.)?

Right now I have 1 1K/month client; not enough to leave my day job over but if I can get 2-3 more into long-term contracts I could be on the way to scaling. "
337,"Uploading Sitemap to Google with Squarespace?Greetings SEO heads. 

I have a very simple question and problem. 

Is it possible to upload my own sitemap.xml file onto Google Search console without having to insert the URL next to my domain? Squarespace autogenerates their own sitemap and doesn't let you customize it (the more I use Squarespace, the more I hate it). I created my own sitemap.xml that I want Google to use, where can I upload it? Or am I screwed here? 

Many thanks!"
338,"Any advice for a SEO noob?I've been working at an agency for several weeks now, as a part of their SEO department. Pretty much entry level. I basically had an internship in digital marketing, and doing SEO work was one of my main responsibilities. Although - in retrospect - it was incredibly repetitive...... I was only working on their title tags/alt text/meta for a bunch of articles, as well as, linkbuilding. 

Now that I'm at an agency, that work seems so simple. I'm doing all these new tasks every week, and I like that I'm soaking in new information every day. 

I really respect my manager - and I definitely hope to be as knowledgeable as she is. I hope to prove to her that I'm in the process of self-studying and that in the future - I'll be able to get a strong hold of the work. I know that I'm entry level - and I've made a few noob mistakes, but I'm willing to work hard for my position. I like going through their decks on certain topics like https migration, xml sitemaps, and topic authority audits - and that's been helping me expand my knowledge. I like following SEO blogs for new updates - and ofc following this subreddit. Hopefully, within a few more months into this job, I can tackle the bigger and more technical tasks with a few more weeks of self-studying.

344,"What is 301 and 302 Redirect? - rank product## WHAT IS A 301 REDIRECT?

A 301 redirect, or also known as a permanent redirect, should be put in place to permanently redirect a page. The word ‘permanent’ is there to imply that ALL qualities of the redirected page will be passed on to the detour page

## WHEN SHOULD I USE A 301 REDIRECT?

An example of when to use the 301 redirect would be if you have changed domains or if you launched your site in a new CMS and your URL structure has changed. Creating 301 redirects for your old content to point to the new content will tell the search engines that you have moved from A to B for good. This will allow search engines to direct ranking and value signals to the new URL because they understand this location to be the new, permanent home for that [content](http://www.rankproduct.com)."

349,"How do I deal with decreases in organic traffic?So I've been working as an SEO analyst for a few months now. I work at an agency that deals with increasing organic traffic for mostly small businesses. The training at this agency is... somewhat lacking. We just get some general direction on how to use Google Analytics and the Keyword Planner, and then they kind of let us loose. I've been doing okay just optimizing Meta Data (title tags, meta descriptions) and implementing relevant keywords into their content, but I feel like there's so much more to SEO and building a client's organic traffic than that. And their ""training"" doesn't show us how to diagnose and fix a decrease in organic traffic. I've had to do a ton of research on my own to try and figure things out, but I feel like I'm just plugging in keywords with traffic and hoping for the best.

For example, I've got a client that sells physical therapy products. Over the past month or so, their organic traffic has been absolutely tanking. I figured out that this was probably related to the August 1st algo update (again, I had to figure this out myself - no direction from management). They don't have anything that indicates they're an authority on physical therapy products. No credentials, no experts or physical therapists named, nothing. So beyond suggesting that they write some content that shows they are an authority on the subject, what should I do to get their organic traffic back up?

And more generally, what do I do when I see that organic traffic is tanking? How do you guys go about improving a website? I genuinely enjoy helping out these smaller businesses, but I feel like I have no knowledge to do so. I'd love to hear from some more experienced members of the SEO community on their processes and how they'd fix a decrease in organic traffic."

352,"Our organic ranking fluctuates while competitors stay consistent.Hi, I'm looking for some advice or insight into why our organic rankings for our main keyword are so inconsistent. We fluctuate weekly (possibly even daily). For example, in the USA, we were sitting at 4th place last week and today we have completely dropped off the front page (for the first time in 5 months). 

We are really stumped as to why this is. For all intents and purposes we have been doing all the right things, optimising for keywords, producing regular, quality content, creating unique keyword optimised landing pages and tracking all of this consistently. We've been tracking the front page rankings weekly over the last 6 months and while we fluctuate heavily, moving up and down on the front page almost week to week, our main competitor stays consistently at 3rd or 4th place.  The reason I am confused by this is because in theory from an outsiders perspective they shouldn't even be on the front page. The produce no content, they have a fairly low amount of backlinks, and their meta descriptions aren't optimised for length or keywords. Their domain has been around for a long time (20 years at least) but using tools like Alexa, they seem to get less traffic and have less backlinks than we do. 

I would love any insight into this, I know it is quite vague but any help would be much appreciated. "

Since our whole website only specializes in wall art and since there isn't even that much of search volume in our targeted geographical location (only about 1.6k a month), we need to rank our homepage (which contains products and products categories) in the #1 spot. 

Anyways, one thing we have avoided so far is to write blog posts with long tail keywords that contain ""wall art"". For example ""Modren wall art"" or ""7 tips to choose the right wall art"" and so on. This is because we are afraid these posts would end up outranking or competing with our home page which is mostly products and not a lot text to optimize for (as with any online store homepage)

Question is, will writing a blog post with the focus keyword ""new trends in wall art"" poses any risk to the ability of the homepage to rank for ""wall art"" or will that actually enhances home page ranking for the seed keyword ? 

Thanks in advances. "

I've heard Pinterest is now starting to do away with the data pin description thing and using alt text as the descriptor. My pin descriptions are still appearing for now, but I'm wondering what would happen if I just started writing Pinterest descriptions in the ALT for all of my new posts? My descriptions are about 200 words so I'm not sure if that's too long? Or if it would hurt since it's not exactly describing the image? Any ideas?"

I'm a FT programmer and have developed websites for clients on the side for many years, but mostly on the side by word of mouth.

I am debating if it should include the location or not, for example webdesignreading (how boring), just my name, or for example something more creative sounding like ""rocket-designs"".

I suppose my main area of clients I will first be targeting are local businesses near by. I work for a university that is well-known in the area, and can probably establish credibility pretty quickly. But I'm not sure if that means I should also include the location in the domain and/or business name.

408,"Domain/Site Age - Content Before LaunchWe're working on a website/platform that won't be ready for launch until mid-September. Original plans were to launch at mid/end of July but dates were set back because the deadlines were very unrealistic (even very seems like an understatement).

Our aim was/is to be ranking in November in time for Christmas, problem is those dates don't really line up with how long it usually takes for our sites/pages to rank. We find it usually takes about 90(ish) days, depending on content/other factors before we start to see any proper ranking for new content.

The idea is to release some temporary/""placeholder"" content until the platform is ready for launch. Our domain is a few months old and has no content on at the current moment in time (it doesn't point to any address). I know that ranking in time for Christmas is unrealistic, but looking to maximize chances anyway. Here are our current ideas:

* Get some quality articles written about the subject of the website and put those up (will be redirected to relevant pages when site launches, likely different URLs but similar content)
* Get some ""placeholder"" content up, same URLs and topics as the platform has but lower-tier content. So we'd have content up for most terms we're trying to rank for. Say the website was about flowers and we had 4 pages for each season, we'd create 4 placeholder articles for those that'd be replaced with the platforms content when launched. We don't want to damage the potential to rank for these terms later on by having content that isn't as good on pages initially, so looking for input on that.

Any input is appreciated. Thanks.

EDIT: To clarify, because the two ideas might not read very well. The first option would be essentially a temporary blog site about the topic, the second option would be a site mimicking the URL/link structure of the platform (but with different articles/content)."

415,"Removing copyrighted content via Google DMCA dashboard - my experience.I manage a few different tech-related websites, and one of them has a recurring issue with spammy websites copying its text and posting it as its own. I usually find these things through copyscape, and most of my requests through the Google dmca Dashboard are successful. In other words, the spammy site owners tend to act pretty quickly once Google threatens to remove their pages from the index.

But here's a new trend... the webmasters for the crappy websites are replying to Google and saying that it is their content, or that they do not have any infringing content and therefore the claim is unmerited.

So what does Google do in that situation? They email you and tell you that you need a subpoena in order to get the content removed.

In other words, as long as the webmaster for the spammy site replies to Google that they have put in a good faith effort to identify any infringing content, and they no longer are in violation, then Google drops the case. They don't actually bother to follow up and see whether they really have removed the content.

The most recent time this happened, it was a very blatant copyright issue that continues to exist. Of course, I have sent Google all of the necessary information including screenshots of our two different sites next to each other to demonstrate the copyright infringement.

The moral of the story is, if you own a crappy website that plagiarizes content, then all you need to do is reply to any Google removal request and say that it is unmerited. And if the original copyright owner does not hire a lawyer, then Google will basically do nothing for them. And your crappy site will remain indexed. It will probably never rank anywhere near the original site, but it will still be there.

It is basically focused around the same theme as our site, so the idea was to copy the content over on our site, likely to our blog section, then redirect the pages there afterwards.  


I assume this is the correct and white hat way to go about it? I've only seen people buy a domain name in random niches and redirect the whole url to their base url.  


If I go this route, should I fish out all the content and repost on our site and make sure all is redirected or is it ok to just do it for part of the site?

429,"How do you guys deal with dumb (literally), computer-illiterate clients?Not understanding how SEO fully works and having unrealistic expectations within a short time frame is one thing. Being literally D.U.M.B. and computer-illiterate ON TOP OF THAT is another.  I have a 60-year old SEO freelance client and I swear I didn't know this guy was this dumb. He fails/refuses to follow the most basic instructions. This causes delay in trying to progress the work I do for him because he's so computer illiterate that he can't do the uttermost basic things and it frustrates the hell out of me.  You guys may be asking then why I brought him in as a client in the first place.  He was a good business partner with my uncle, was looking for SEO services for his site that sells various golf products, so i got introduced to him. Had a conversation, seemed like a good guy, explained the fundamentals of SEO, he seemed to have got it - so I took a chance, why not.

Boy do I regret this decision.

Let me give an example of what happened: He didn't know how to access his GSC property registered under the e-mail I created for him so I was more than glad to show him how to do that with clear screenshots attached. He continuously had trouble when all he had to was follow my step-by-step instructions with the screenshot attached. Then he gets frustrated and responds to me in the e-mail in all caps, 'I DON'T HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE TO DO THIS MIKE, I'M SEEING SOMETHING DIFFERENT"".

So out of mere frustration, I tell him to take a screenshot of what he's seeing on his screen. As expected, I get an ""I don't know"" answer. I give him the instructions on how to take a screenshot. 2 days later, I get a response saying he physically PRINTED OUT THE PAGE of what he saw and physically mailed it to my address. Like, who the f does this? Guy's about to give me cancer, I swear. Sorry if I'm ranting but I just don't know how to deal with and manage such a retarded client like this. All he had to do was take a quick screenshot that takes 2 seconds, attach the image to the e-mail and send it over. Why physically print the page and mail it to me?

Second example: 2 months into the contract, he sends me an e-mail in all caps once again sounding like he's flipping out, going full retard. Asks, ""WHY AM I NOT RANKING PAGE 1 FOR GOLF GLOVE WHEN I PAID YOU TO HELP ME FIX THIS"". Then of course I had to write up a concise 3 paragraph answer for him to fully comprehend and understand. Completely understandable. I had to explain to him in baby steps how the Google algorithm works (when I already did when I first met him in person), what ""keyword volume"" is, what ""keyword intent"" is, and all the different aspects of keywords tied within SEO and other SEO elements. But asides from just all of this SEO stuff, this guy is a fucking computer-illiterate dumbnut who fails to do anything with a computer other than responding to my e-mails. Another example - wanted to set up a [join.me](https://join.me) video conference call - that way it would be much easier communicating WHILE showing the material to him...literally in front of his screen with my voice. What gets better than that? Sent him the download link - and guess what. Guy had a difficult time downloading, didn't bother with instructions and just wanted to talk on the phone.

430,"3 Posts Competing With Each Other in SERPs I've got 3 posts that are competing with one another in SERPs.

Right now, the target keywords are similar but not 100% the same. As an example, let's say the keywords are ""apple cider recipes"" ""how to make apple cider"" and ""best homemade apple cider""

It seems that the keywords I'm targeting don't get enough volume to really have much differentiation in Google's algorithm so all 3 posts are competing. As a result, all 3 posts are in top 10 but none are in top 5.

What should I do? I've identified a few possible solutions (there are prob more, these are just the obvious ones that came to mind):

\-- delete two of the posts and then set up permanent redirects to send traffic to the third post that remains online

\-- re-work two of the posts to target more distinct keywords, as to eliminate the competition

\-- add no-index tags to 2 of the posts so they dont appear in SERPs but keep them online anyway

461,"What is the fastest way to fully remove a site from Google?Google has indexed 2000+ URLs of a subdomain  which I don't want indexed (it was a staging/UAT version of the site). These URLs have been in the index since 3 or 4 years ago.

My first attempt was to apply this robots.txt:

    User-agent: *
    Disallow: /

But after months of waiting I found out that this will only tell Google not to crawl anything else on the site, but already indexed pages are not being taken down.

My second attempt was to kill the subdomain via DNS (made it return NXDOMAIN). Waited for a month or so but indexed pages were still there.

My third attempt (current) was to fix DNS, allow crawling via robots.txt but for every page return content ""123"" and meta tag `X-Robots-Tag: noindex`. I'm not sure whether this will work since I've been waiting almost for 20 days with this method and results are still there.

Another option would be to use google webmaster tools and try to remove those 2000+ URLs one by one. Of course this is not optimal.

Is there another way to solve this problem?

463,"How to do keyword research on a complicated niche?I'm a SEO newbie trying to do some keyword research on my niche (poker) but I'm having some serious doubts.

Should I research for my main keyword (poker)? Or should I try to research for keywords familiar to poker players, like ""how to continuation bet""?

The main difficult is, poker players don't usually google strategy. They already know where to find it, which usually is in private coaches, books or video trainings. And if I try to appeal to new players, I can't go too far from the ""how to play poker"" articles that are already well established by online poker rooms like PokerStars.

The site is ranking just on page one (position 10) for it's main keyword and I have done a full link audit. This is where things get interesting. It is not a particularly competitive keyword at 1900 monthly searches (bear this in mind).

The clients link portfolio is make up solely of web 2.0s, directories and some blog comments (not created by me!!). Now if any of my other sites had spammy links I would simply disavow them as the rest of the link profile is sound enough. But here the client is ranking solely on spam and I am finding it hard to draw a line between deciding which spam I should disavow and which spam I should leave as mass disavowing would be suicidal in my humble oppinion.

Then I read this a post suggesting that disavowing does nothing anyway and I am thinking to just ignore the spam and begin building decent links.

I need to note, some links have a high spam score on Moz as one option I am thinking of is to disavow these ones that are highlighted as really spammy and leave the others are not being flagged as too spammy.

479,"2 business, same client, same location, GMBI have a small client who has 2 business from his home address. He handles most of his own SEO, and I occasionally do some small ad campaigns for him
The client runs private classes/workshops from his home, which is also a B&amp;B and offers local tours. 

There is a connection between the 2, as he does sell the classes to customers that stay at the B&amp;B and take the local tours. In some cases he sells the class with accomodation included. So there is a big cross over with both business. Although the B&amp;B can be booked independently.

I've told him this is one business with multiple services, but he insists they are seperate and have a seperate website and should have seperate GMB listings, which he wants to set up himself. 

Apparantly, he has been on the phone with Google to get the business listed, and google want further proof the second business is at that location. On Google maps they can see the sign out front for the workshops.
The workshop site has a listing on GMB and shows for local searches, but the B&amp;B doesn't. 

Is there a way I can help him here? or should he just bite the bullet and accept that if Google thinks it's one listing at the address then it's one listing. 

The only other solution I could give him was to list the second address as 'apartment A' and see if Google buys it. But TBH I don't think it will fly. 

His two websites also promote each other. On the classes website there is a section for accomodation and tours, and on the B&amp;B website there is a section dedicated to classes.

488,"How Blogging help in SEO?Great blogging can provide your business with a secret weapon for maximizing your local rankings when it comes to search engine optimization. There are a few distinct reasons for this, not least of which is that very few businesses are using blogging to its full potential. Most businesses ignore blogs, as they aren’t considered to be part of the “bread and butter” of digital marketing, but this is a critical error that can cost you dearly in terms of your search engine rankings. Most people see blogs as something casual, or dedicated to long-form writing. They’re particularly useful for SEO purposes because, when they’re well written, they provide content that is both informative and engaging to your consumers.

**Taking Advantage of Trends**

Recent trends in the digital marketing landscape have shifted away from the short sponsored posts that once dominated the market. Today’s search engines don’t opt as much for keyword saturation and egregious link building, but instead prioritize sites that feature long content. Users, too, are shifting their attention towards long content, and savoring the experience of reading a well-researched, easy-to-read piece of a few thousand words article. Take advantage of this trend by structuring a blog pertaining to your business according to the types of long content that perform well on search engine rankings.

**Tips and Tricks**

While you can do whatever you like with your blog, there are a few tips and trick that you might like to use so that you can maximize your business’s SEO potential. For example, you want to write blog posts that are informative without being too stuffy or formal in their language or form, as they’re aimed at a casual audience. When it comes to the tone of your blog, you want it to be consistent with your business’s branding so that it adequately conveys your mission and what you as a business stand for. Once you’ve created the content, you can get to work on keywords, link building, and integrating references to your local area. The blog must be a seamless part of your business’s website, too, so it’s easy to access and will help your search engine rankings.

[**How to Create a Great SEO Blog:**](http://dwellsolutions.in)

**Humanize Your Articles**

First of all, ensure that your blog authors include a byline with a bit of information about them. This will humanize your employees in the eyes of the readership, making your business seem more “real” to them and encouraging future engagement. Google treats blogs with author tags preferentially, and prioritizes them over blogs that don’t acknowledge authorship.

**Research**

Always do your research, both on your blog topic and which keyword combinations are going to improve your search engine rankings. Customizing and tailoring your titles, matching the URLs with the keywords, and using strategic mentions of your location are great ways to maximize your blog’s SEO potential. One element of great research is awareness of the media. When the media start to squawk about your industry, you want your business to be ready for the massive surge in searches and traffic that accompanies any and every media furor.

**Tags and Links to Related Posts**

You should definitely include tag pages and links to related posts. This is common practice across most of the world’s industries with a foot in the door of the digital marketplace. How many times have you been reading a blog when you saw an ad for a similar story at the foot of the page? This helps to enhance your topical keyword associations, and will assist your loyal readers in finding similar content on your site and through your blog.

**Post Regularly**

It’s critical that you post regularly as well. You wouldn’t buy your favorite paper (that is, if you still pay for a physical newspaper) if it weren’t published at regular intervals. The same goes for your blog. If you fail to post regularly – even if it’s only once a week – your customers will get bored of waiting for new content and find something else to read. As long as you produce new content for your blog at regular intervals, you’ll keep the traffic coming in and your search engine rankings won’t suffer in the process. People love stability when it comes to their chosen services, so give your audience what they crave and provide well-researched blog posts that your readers and customers can enjoy and look forward to every week.

504,"I specialize in getting top-tier, high authority backlinks, here's how I do it... also, anyone looking to potentially team up?Hey guys,

So as the title suggests I specialize in getting big backlinks for clients... like domain authority 60 DA and up. The formula is actually extremely simple... you create a newsworthy item or something really cool content wise and then pitch it out to journalists that write about similar or relevant topics.

And what I mean by that is as follows: So I had an auto client that needed some big links. So I scanned the news headlines looking for something I could latch onto.

Well at that time, Trump was thinking about instituting that 25% auto tariff. And based on that, Toyota came out with a press release saying that tariff would increase the cost of the Camry by $1800.

Well after some digging, I found the formula they used to get that specific number, I then applied it to 10 other top selling cars in the US.

So now I have some really intriguing data than I can pitch to journalists about a newsworthy relevant topic.

I then find journalists who write about that subject, and shoot them a very quick and simple email with the data (and tell them my client created it, not me, so my client gets credit).

After about 50 to 100 emails, the data got picked up, articles were written (by the journalists, not me), and my client got some really nice top-tier links, for example from CBS News, The Daily Caller and more.

Another time, I made a retro Tesla Starman video game that got picked up all over the place.. Mashable, CNET, etc.

Basically the formula is extremely simple... make something awesome, or newsworthy, and then pitch it out there.

This kind of link building is getting tougher, but it still works with the right type of content.

The only fall back is it's a bit like fishing... many times you create content that never gets picked up. So you essentially go to the lake, cast your line, and don't catch any ""fish."" That is frustrating, but it is what it is.

Using this method I've gotten in most of the top sites, with the exception of the New York Times and sites like The Wall Street Journal, that hardly ever use outside content.

Again, the concept isn't hard to grasp, you just have to come up with the right content and be creative.

With that said, I'm kind of looking to expand a bit, maybe team up with some people. Reason being is that frustrating part about creating content and not getting anything out of it. There is nothing worse than spending 3 days on something, and getting absolutely nothing out of it... so I'm looking for other ways to offer the service, maybe create a different kind of package to offer, where I get compensated for all the content I'm created, instead of just the content that generates links.

Anyway, just throwing feelers out there! Cheers!"
505,"Cornerstone content structure questionI have a tutorial website that writes step by step articles on how to modify android phones

Building a Cornerstone content piece around (how to root a phone) seems like a great idea 

To root a phone though, you have to do a lot of other things first. Including booting into fastboot mode, unlocking the bootloader, installing a custom recovery, etc

So it is to my understanding that I need to go back through all of those previous articles and add some content update that links to the new Cornerstone content

My question is, should I be doing internal links from that Cornerstone content to those individual articles that explains how unlock the bootloader, how to install a custom recovery, etc. 

Will that give less seo juice to the Cornerstone content if I'm doing internal linking to other posts? 

I ask because knowing how to root a phone is a complex process, but something that ranks well.

My thought is to give a summary of why we need to unlock bootloader to root the phone, and then link to my step-by-step article for it

Then continue through this process which would have like 5-10 internal links inside my Cornerstone content 

So what are the thoughts on this process. Will that be the ideal method, or should I write out all of those steps again (for how to unlock the bootloader) in the Cornerstone content. It seems writing those steps again could be considered duplicate/competing content 

Where the section of 'how to unlock the bootloader' section of my Cornerstone content will be competing with my dedicated bootloader article "

The problem is how do I create a clean category hiearchy structure on each page if there are a ton of categories for each product?

The menu navigation will house a lot of thee links to the random category pages. 

For example a Nike T-shirt could be in categories like Nike, clothing, tshirts, athletic gear, lifestyle clothes, training apparel, nike tech fleece, nike dri fit, nike basketball, nikelab

those are all the categories and they all have purpose. but how do i add a product to all these categories but maintain a clean link hierarchy on the page like Nike / Nikelab / Product Name ?

Our website is pretty much static, and in so far as functionality goes, it has a form element to get info from potential clients, and a pop-up chat widget that redirects the user to another site to chat with someone in our office; no back end to speak of. As far as I can tell, the website is built with Wordpress, has a custom theme (a pretty bad one with a shit ton of sloppy, outdated code, which also appears to be used and duplicated for their other clients, and almost universally relies on outside libraries to even do simple CSS animations, eg, sliding in an element from the left or right), and using plugins like Yoast to do all the heavy lifting with their SEO.

537,"Is my client getting scammed?Sorry in advance for the long post, and thank you so much for taking the time. I just need unbiased feedback in an area that is outside my expertise. 

I'm a business strategy consultant, not a digital marketer (so please forgive my lack of detailed technical understanding... Please ELI5). 

I have a client who is a local business owner (trades). He's been paying $500/mo for SEO on 3-5 search terms for over a year. Don't get me wrong, his business ranks number one for those terms, so a lot of things were obviously done right.

He doesn't do content marketing of any sort, so the website hasn't really changed. The website has 32 backlinks from 16 domains, almost all of them business directories. If it's relevant, he posts OC to Facebook about once per week. No advertising at all. However, he has over 100 5* Google reviews (they're a really awesome local business who have a great service and do it well). 

My client had a falling out with his SEO guy and would like me to find him a new one for the same rate. That's easy enough for me to do, but from my very basic understanding of SEO, I'm not sure what they'd do unless we start creating new website content? 

I have 5 interrelated questions (so I can advise how to proceed and justify myself one way or the other):

1. Was my client getting scammed paying $500/mo for over a year without new content or backlinks outside directories? What am I missing? 

2. What investment level (hours, not $) is required each month to maintain his organic results?

3. If we go the content route, what is the minimum post length and frequency to get good results (or is it beneficial at all)? 

4. How important is regular social posting for SEO, specifically?

5. Do you know of any non-technical resources for local business about what needs to be done, why, for how long, what results to expect, and how much to pay?

Thanks so much for the input! I really, really appreciate it. "

I work for a reputable online ecommerce site. Recently someone reached out and offered to lease us his domain, with the idea being he'd 301 all pages on his site to ours. We would collect the massive amount of traffic, around 1m yearly visits, and hopefully convert many into subscribers/customers. 

Let's assume for example his site is [tires.com](https://tires.com) and we own [yourdailytire.com](https://yourdailytire.com) selling just one tire per day. We don't have a large sitemap with many products. Just one. So we couldn't reasonably 301 his site pages to an equally relevant page on our site - everything to the homepage.

I'm inclined to think Google would drop a lot of the rankings for his search terms and we probably wouldn't get nearly the same amount of traffic. 

The price is actually fair, if we assume that the 1m or so visits actually convert into subscribers/customers at a similar rate as our normal visitors do.

&gt;This means that you may see more traffic in your logs from Googlebot Smartphone. You may also see that snippets in Google Search results are now generated from the mobile version of your content.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Background:** Mobile-first indexing means that Googlebot will now use the mobile version of your site for indexing and ranking, to better help our (primarily mobile) users find what they're looking for. Google’s crawling, indexing, and ranking systems have historically used the desktop version of your site's content, which can cause issues for mobile searchers when the desktop version differs from the mobile version.

Is this just because our efforts so far have been super-minimal super-organic and sites pushing/trying too hard to rank higher are being penalised by google to prevent rank/spam manipulation or have I missed the point?

I'm asking as I'm trying to work out where to take our long term SEO plan, how hard to push with backlinks/content keyword targeting before it looks to over the top/spammy? Also any advice...? :) "
578,"Those who got smashed by this algo update, what's your recovery plan?As someone with a site consisting of 90% product reviews, I got completely smashed in this update. 

My plan is to move away from reviews and start to fill the website with more informative, non-review content, to the point where it's at least 50/50. 

After looking at my competition (all whom have sites with similar content), it seemed they all lost traffic big time, which leads me to a theory that google doesn't like sites that aren't ""well rounded"" and purely exist to review and upsell an internal offer. 

I could be talking crap, but as all my links are white hat and my content is rock solid, I have a feeling that the problems lies somewhere else. "

I've been in the SEO game for a few years holding a few clients as a freelancer, as a side gig to my development (I'm not a die-hard developer, but just know my way around several technologies, frameworks and especially WordPress). Over the years I've been getting more into SEO/IM than development since I've been working with clients that have online stores. I like everything that revolves around sales, email marketing, advertising, customer retention etc.   


I'm relocating to Czech Republic in the following few months and would like to increase my income, and even work harder to reach some of my short and long term goals. Since I have a strong development background, I'd like to get in some new clients and offer something that not a lot of SEO guys offer as a sole service - technical SEO. I've been working a lot lately with fixing broken links, monitoring crawled pages, improving website speed, Google Tag Manager, caching, minification, CDN etc. I would say that I can definitely **ONLY** improve a client's technical SEO if I am hired. Considering that, I would like to ask you guys the following:  


1. **What do you consider as technical SEO**
2. **What would you expect to be delivered by a freelancer that offers to improve your technical SEO**
3. **Do you think that a lot of usual clients would buy an EXCLUSIVELY technical SEO gig without the link building etc.**

I work with websites for businesses and we're looking to optimize their sales pages. Obviously, we understand that long form content in the form of blog posts are excellent for SEO.

But in terms of sales pages for their services, we find that long copy doesn't covert well. 

Is there any way we can optimize these pages to target keywords and have them rank without having a lot of copy. 

Obviously the less copy you have, the more apparent it will be to a reader that you're targeting keywords. We don't want the content to be spammy, as it will stick out like a sore thumb.

Another thing worth to mention, I do not use Apache/Nginx webservers and all my content is static (S3 based), which means If I have to achieve the same thing today (which I am), I'm doing it through some javascript (check for url parameters, hide/display div based on language). But this .js hack is definitely not the best for multiple reasons (e.g: because I work at DOM level, my two menus are shortly displayed when you arrive on the page etc)

So back to my point, what's the SEO impact of having 2 pages, same content, but just minor menu translation?

6 years in SEO, last 2 have been managing a team of 2 specialists, and recently a LOT more. Position has quickly changed from just managing our campaigns to what I feel is Director level work. Current salary is 70k.

Small(ish) agency, high cost of living state but NOT in a major city. My current title is Manager but I'm running our entire SEO department (...of 3 people atm) now. Agency is a total of 11 people including owners, however with our growth rate right now we're going to be adding people very soon.

Agency recently came under new ownership/management. New management didn't know anything about SEO before meeting me, and are now extremely excited to be able to sell it. They had a previous client base that they brought in and will be selling new big SEO deals to. Also now selling to a much broader &amp; more lucrative market than we used to sell to.

I'm the only one here who can develop strategy for clients and the agency itself, price out SEO work, ensure the work is completed correctly, and speak to technical SEO details to clients. I have quickly gone from speaking with owners of SMBs to speaking &amp; pitching to C-level execs multimillion (some billion) megacorps. It's been scary, awesome, and confidence-boosting all at once to be able to be part of closing those kinds of deals.

I feel like the level of work I'm doing in this new environment is WAY, WAY above the normal tasks of an SEO Manager.

Should also note that new management loves me right now. I haven't broached salary yet but have been told multiple times how I am opening up huge potential revenue opportunities for us. I also have very specific knowledge of our target industries that any new person coming in would have to really truly understand in order to succeed. Mostly just gained from years of working with very specific clients.

I'm struggling with how much to ask for. I know someone in a Director role in NYC could probably get 125k, but we're not quite at that level. However, I kind of feel like even that would be a bit low for what I'm doing and the value I'm providing the company now. Just feels a little crazy to ask for a jump that high. I may propose a title bump to Director of Inbound Marketing or something and take over PPC &amp; email too.

In addition to a salary boost, how strange would it be to request like 3% of revenue that comes in directly for SEO?"

651,"Should we cancel our SEO specialist's contract?I'm a VA turned social media marketer and blogger for a small health and fitness startup company. We launched the business this year on February. At first, I was the one tasked to manage and create content for our social media so during the first few months we were actively posting on Instagram and doing curated contents on Facebook since we haven't started publishing blog posts that time. But we had made some changes in our strategies and the role for handling the social media was turned over to my client's business partner and then on May, he also hired an SEO specialist to help our website's ranking since it is important for the business to have good online visibility since it is offering online services (online yoga, personal training, physiotherapy). The problem is since then our online presence has declined since she hasn't started with the social media campaign and we are just starting to create blog posts (we only have like 3 blogs on the website as of now) and we do not have even a single full-paying customer at the moment. All of our existing ""customers"" are discounted or free in exchange of them promoting the business on their personal pages. So now, my client is thinking of cutting his cost. He would like to pause or cancel the contract of our SEO specialist. We know that it takes time to see results especially since we have a lot of competitors in our niche, but base on the weekly reports he is submitting I can see that there is barely an improvement in any of our keywords ranking. His strategies for off-page optimization includes profile creation, social bookmarking, image, classified, and PPT submissions. I see no sense in the social bookmarking and image submission strategy since we do not have any good content yet to share to our main social pages let alone to social bookmarking and image sharing sites. So he's creating images on his own and directly posting them to the website profiles he had created without consulting to us about them. On my judgment, the text posts, images shared to the websites seem spammy to me and doesn't give value to people and they are just there posted for the sake of backlinks and I'm concerned that it would give a negative effect to the website ranking or worst the company. Sure, they are links and those backlinks are getting some traffic to the website but those links are causing us to have a high bounce rate. My question is, do we cancel his contract and focus first on getting our heads on straight on our plans and more importantly on our content marketing? This is a very small company that doesn't have an income yet, do you think that the SEO service is necessary at this stage of his business? "

653,"Prefill Email MarketingHello everyone,

I have a question regarding Email marketing and SEO.

Our goal is to have as many subscribers to our multiple and different E-mail newsletters, as possible, so we want to make it even easier to signup from our newsletter form. I was thinking about prefilling the ""e-mail"" and ""name"" section of the user and this way make it easier for them to just hit ""send"", thus growing our subscription rate.

This data is only going to be taken if the user has already signed up for other newsletter on our site (as I said we have multiple newsletters).

My questions are:

* would there be any GDPR problems regarding this, since we are going to take data that the user once provided but we are just going to show it to them when he goes to another page of our website;
* are there any SEO dangers - is the data more vulnerable this way and are we going to be attacked by email harvesters;
* are there any good practices regarding this case.

Thanks in advance to everyone who answers. I think it's an interesting case for a discussion :)

664,"Page Rank: Is it okay for /general-content/ to also have all the content that is on /general-content/specific-content/?I'm building some pages with before-and-after photo galleries on them, and I'm trying to figure out the best site structure that would yield the highest ranked pages.

There is a page called `/before-and-after/`, which is an overview of all the before-and-after pages (there are maybe 15), containing links to all of these pages with short descriptions.

The more specific pages are structured like `/before-and-after/houses/`, `/before-and-after/apartments/`, etc. The `/before-and-after/` general page contains links to these sub pages.

I would think that, if `/before-and-after/` contained all the content for these specific pages that could be dynamically loaded in to the page (for instance, clicking on Houses would dynamically load in Houses content rather than loading the page `/before-and-after/houses/`), it would make  before-and-after a more useful page with a longer visit time, and could help its ranking.

I could also somehow canonicalize the more specific pages like `/before-and-after/houses/` so that they would not be hurt by the duplicate content. Or maybe I wouldn't even need more specific pages at that point.

What is the best approach here?

**A) Put houses content only on `/before-and-after/houses/` and not on `/before-and-after/`**

**B) Don't even have specific content pages, and instead put all content, including houses and  apartments content on `/before-and-after/`**

**C) Have houses and apartments content on `/before-and-after/` that can be dynamically/asynchronously loaded in, but also have more specific pages like `/before-and-after/houses/` that are canonicalized for their topic**

I'm guessing either one of these choices could work depending on the content, but I'm wondering if others have felt they've gotten better results doing this one way over another."

671,"SEO for beginners: why you need itTo have a SEO- optimized resource is not only trendy for any website creator but also highly necessary for website success. There are some reasons for you why you need SEO in your online resource: 

1) Organic search is usually a primary source of website traffic. People believe that GOOGLE knows everything. That\`s why they so often start their purchases from this channel. Being highly visible as a trusted resource in the search engines always works in a brand’s favor. 

2) Smart SEO helps your website get more trust and credibility. A website with beautiful and clear user experience, a website that can be easily found by search engines is usually more noticeable among thousands of its competitors. SEO is something that will help you achieve such results. 

3) Local SEO, with the growth of mobile traffic, helps you raise engagement, traffic and conversions. It aims at optimizing your digital properties for a specific vicinity, so people can find you quickly and easily, which makes them one step closer to a transaction. 

4) SEO is relatively cheap. Of course, not all things can be done for free. But, for sure, the payoff will most likely be considered in terms of a brand’s benefit and bottom line. 

5) SEO is a long-term strategy. This instrument can\`t be used for 2 or 3 months and be expected to get great results. If you choose SEO - be ready to work with it systematically - and achieve your strategic goals. 

6) SEO results can be measured. The great thing is that SEO indicators are easy to measure. You can measure almost anything with proper tracking and analytics. "

673,"[Suggestions welcome] How to optimize for few different 'services' in webpagesDear SEO community,

I am running a project which aims to completely redesign our small/medium Business-to-Business webpages hailing from 1990-2000's. One of the many goals is to optimize and make content readable for web-crawlers, sharpen up the URL-structure and create content for visitor personas.

We offer few different services for clients, lets call them ""Service A"", ""Service B"" and ""Service C"". I am wondering how should I shape up the structure, URL's and content of these areas so web-crawlers would be happy. My gut-feeling in pushing me to create separate pages for each service and ensure that pages are optimized for that service specific keyword. URL-structure and navigation level example below:

1. Home
2. /services
3. //service-A  
//service-B  
//service-C

This however, leaves me with dilemma of having to have a 'Service landing page' and visitors are forced to click through it before landing on any of the specific service pages. Not sure is this the best visitor experience or best practice.

One solution I have been thinking is to collect everything in one 'services' page and use some (quite nice) ways to present content using e.g. accordion/click-to-expand articles or tabs where content is on same page, but hidden before user clicks to expand the info. But this however, most probably dilutes SEO juice as -think that- I cannot assign too many H1 and different keywords in single URL-page. 

Should I go with the gut feeling, or would you have some different feedback or guidance to provide? Any feedback regarding this is most welcome.

Best regards,

So quick question. I'm launching a cold email marketing campaign. We're not buying lists, but essentially we're buying individual contact info that we're going to use to compile a large(ish) list. Small distinction. 

Anyways, I acquired a second domain just to make sure our primary domain doesn't get in any way dented/blacklisted/ flagged by this less than stellar strategy.

So if we're example.com, my new domain is xmple.com. Can I stick that in my existing G Suite? Or do I risk contaminating the primary domain by association (if only by Google?). 

And if so whats the best practice? Can I add it as an alias to the primary? Does it need to be added as a totally separate domain? Should we get another Gsuite account to firewall it completely?

I'd greatly appreciate some help getting something set up:

I'm using ""Sender"" to set up a system where people can get daily homework lessons sent out if they subscribe to a e-mail list, or something like that.

How can I get it so that people can have the e-mails sent out to them without my needing to manually add them to the list?

Should I use the triggers ""Subscriber joins a list"" or ""A link is clicked""?

I was hoping to simply make it so that someone can just click on a link, or something, on my website. But I'm not sure how to go about doing it. 

Like, on my website (www.EvansEasyJapanese.com), how could I have a button that says ""click here to get daily e-mail homework sent directly to you!"", and then they click it, and then get the e-mails?

When I use ""A link is clicked"" it asks for a URL... I need to make a special URL for each link? Does it need to be a real URL?

Could I just put a list of these lessons on my website with ""fake"" URLs that they can click to trigger the e-mails?

Do the e-mails need to come from an e-mail, or could they just be links on my website?

55,"What should happen when a user changes their email address?Hi all,

When a user changes their email address on a website, what should this mean for their verified and optin statuses?

I'm planning to force re-verification, thus re-locking them out of the site similar to their account state when they first sign up.  This feels a bit heavy handed, but I want to ensure always having valid addresses.  Would you consider this worth the UX overhead?

That aside, I am also wondering:

1. Is it reasonable to assume their optin status is preserved with the change, or should there be a re-optin on the new address?

2. What should happen to their initial (now outdated) email address on a list?  Assuming I add their new one, they'd potentially receive emails twice.  Should I unsubscribe it or delete it completely?

61,"Need advice on segmenting contact data!Hi,

I've recently started interning at a medical conference planning company, and noticed they have a massive problem with segmentation. They target over 30,000 contacts with the same email and for a medical field, I believe it unwise to target a psychiatrist with a conference about surgery, for example. The problem is, they have already set up an entire database that doesn't include the specialty, and I'm not sure how I can go about segmenting this data without starting from scratch.

The platform they use is Constant Contact (potentially will switch them to Amazon) and they have lists for every conference they have done in the past, but that results in very small amounts of specialized contacts once I merge the files (300 or so). I have sent out a very simple survey that asks contacts to only pick specialties they are interested in but only got about 150 responses from 30,000 emails. What else can I possibly do to help this company when there are over 20 specialties? Is it unrealistic to target in this industry?

Here is the case:

\- We have collected a base of 250 precisely selected contacts, who might like our offer of collaboration

\- List consists of University professors who lecture on a small list of subjects

\- Offer is 100% free of charge, with no tricks etc. - we are a non-profit, and offer a win-win collaboration

\- If they would read it - about 50% of them would like it and be ready to collaborate

How should we send such offer? Technically it is a spam, since they didn't subscribe. But this is no a ""subscription"" - there will be no ""newsletter"" or any following letters - there will be a dialogue with those who got interested. And therefore there is no need for ""unsubscribe"" button - there is nothing to unsubscribe from.

I have run my own [website/blog](http://themaneffect.com/) since 2014 and had a small email list that I reach out to weekly with Mailchimp. You can check out the link if you want but it is kinda irrelevant in my opinion.

- I am not sure what tool to use for email campaings. I am open to suggestions and guessing there are like a million out there. I don't like mailchimp and want something that allows for tracking when a email is opened and has a better user interface. 
- Are there any core articles or websites I should read through to help get me into the mindset of email marketing. 
- My client base is extremely niche so I may only send out a total of 1-2k emails when it is all said and done. Are there tools that I could use for free because of how small of quantity this is? 
- What are things to avoid when making an email as personal as possible? 
- I want to automate as much as possible so if it takes longer on the front end to do it right I am more than okay with this. That being said what mistakes have you made in this way that you wish you approached differently.

I think that is enough questions for now. Thanks in advance to anyone willing to help me out.

117,"Launching an email template package in 1-2 weeks (MVP, 50 templates) - thoughts on pricing, offering?Hi everyone, I have been working on an **incredibly developer friendly** email package for a while that I want to release for sale next week, maybe the week after on producthunt, depending how long it takes to test all the templates.

**I'm looking for your thoughts on the offering and pricing and in general any other ideas and feedback.**(this is my first side project I want to make money with, so I'm testing new waters here)

I pride myself in offering good pricing, but would like to hear what you think, more on that below.

# The set includes:

* 50 responsive email templates
* 10 different footer designs
* themeable with light and dark mode
* built via the inky framework from ZURB, which allows incredible flexibility to adjust all templates with changing a few lines of code. **E. g. switching out the footer for all 50 templates is only a code change of one line.** Check out [this link](https://foundation.zurb.com/emails.html#inky-comparison) why this is without a doubt the best way to maintain your email templates if you have a developer. I have loved inky's approach for years, it's a shame not enough people are aware of this amazing framework. Over time I've mastered it quite a bit, so these templates are high quality :).
* **will be litmus tested among majority of email clients** (however probably won't support super old ones, this is geared towards startups, inky has pretty good base support for consistent email template rendering, I will fix all visual bugs but might not go out of my way to try and smash a hammer against a wall to make it work in really old email clients . Those clients probably aren't my target market anyway)
* templates will be available as original inky source code (amazing customization before generating the HTML template to copy &amp; paste) and final HTML templates that you simply copy and paste into your mail provider of choice
* the project will come with docs on how everything works
* I will accomodate bug fixes as much as possible and additional templates for the most expensive offer can be requested via email even after purchase

**You can see some samples of the templates at the end of the post after the question on pricing;**

**Here is what I am thinking in regards to pricing. Please let me know what you think:**

* **USD 39**
   * responsive
   * litmus tested
   * 25 templates
* **USD 69**
   * responsive
   * litmus tested
   * 50 templates
* **USD 79**
   * responsive
   * litmus tested
   * 50 templates
   * 10 footers
   * color themes included

Personally, I feel that the pricing is too cheap, especially if you compare this with other offers out there on product hunt (e. g. there is one set of only 5 templates that is sold for 39 bucks, that's pretty expensive in my opinion). I would love to hear your thoughts. I have worked a lot on this, so I want to have fair pricing that will pay the bills for me :).

My long term goal would be to get to 99 email templates eventually, with the same pricing as given above.

# Here are some samples of the templates.

118,"Service to send 'random' email to 'random' user?Hello. I want to create a service where each user will get a random email (from my 'email database') until they have eventually gotten them all. 

For example, lets pretend my website is cooking tips, and I have 100 tips in my database. Users would then receive a random tip every day for 100 days.

What I would love to be able to do is:

* Take a random user from my user list
* Take a random not-yet-sent (to the specific user) tip (in HTML form)
* Send the HTML file + email address to a service and have the service deal with delivering it
* Mark the tip as 'sent' to the user
* Repeat for each user, every day

I don't think sending emails from my own server is a good idea, but that is only because I've heard it said with deliverability and so on. 

Any ideas of where I should look? I haven't dealt with emails before honestly so excuse me if this is a bit of a newbie question."
124,"Forced to Import Bought Mailing List (Best way to approach)Hi everyone,

I started a new job and the boss has some mailing lists they used for sales which he wants imported for email marketing.

I have told him the bad that will happen, he seems to think it's normal and wants me to go ahead with sending unsolicited emails.

Current database of 1200 legit subscribers. Has a 20k list divided into many industry sectors, planning on somehow introducing piece by piece. How can I minimise damage it does to the integrity and spam ratings? Is there some way to send an entire reconfirm campaign to turn them legitimate. If people don't want it, I don't want to send it to them, just to let my boss know they dismissed it so I can move on.

It's with MailChimp and the option of saying no will have bad consequences I don't want to face. Any suggestions?

125,"Can I use any of the Adobe programs to design emails?I can't stand using Mailchimp to create emails, I just can't seem to get them how I want them and learning to code is out of the question really. Email marketing is only a small part of my job so I can't really spend a ton of time learning to code when I'm stretched pretty thin as it is. 

I work for a small company so subscribing to some sort of email design service (if that even exists, might have just made that up) isn't an option either, I'm given a budget of pretty much £0 - which is just wonderful! 

I do have Adobe Creative Cloud though. Is it possible to design emails within one of their programs? 

I know it's probably a long shot and/or a stupid question but I thought I'd ask the experts.

Thanks in advance"
126,"Launching an email newsletter from scratchLast Wednesday I launched an email newsletter from scratch. When we launched our website hadn't even had any traffic yet. Today, a week after launch, we have over 350 subscribers. This post is a summary of what what worked and what didn't. 

  
**What we did well (that you can implement):**

* **Find your ideal customer, then offer them something that they can’t refuse.** Our ideal customer was entrepreneurs and people trying to start online businesses. Our offer: a free startup idea in your inbox every day. About 30&amp;#37; of all website traffic ends up subscribing.
* **Drive Traffic using relevant channels.** Our target audience was entrepreneurs, so we mostly posted on IndieHackers, Reddit, Hacker News, and Quora.

**What we can improve on:**

* **Give people a reason to come back.** Our website is just a landing page, so people are obviously not coming back. We need to fix that.
* **Get links.** This is hard. But getting a link or mention from a relevant source helps. We didn't focus on this at all, but are starting to now.

**In summary, I think its a 4 step pattern for growing your list.** 

1. Find your ideal customer
2. Build a landing page and offer that gets your ideal customer to sign up.
3. Drive traffic.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3.

I hope this helps someone.

I'd love to hear some feedback about what you think we could have done better.

I have mailgun to setup for sending and receiving emails that direct back to my gmail accounts.

The first draft of te email is below. (CN) is used here to stand in for the  company name.

Hi (CN),

We are ****, a high-end furniture manufacturer, and we have a business proposition that will benefit both of us.

**** is fairly unique among Vietnam’s furniture developers in that it places a strong emphasis on design aesthetic of its products in addition to engineering and functionality. We urge you to visit https://****.com.vn/ and browse our collections to get an idea for the uncompromising attractiveness and quality of our products.

In our endless quest for design inspiration, we stumbled across (CN), were enamored with the stunning design prowess on display, and felt our two companies would be an excellent fit in a mutually beneficial business relationship.

During your showings, you of course need to furnish the spaces on display in a way that brings out the most attractive aspects of the space. This is where ****’s furniture, modern industrial pieces with design inspired by iconic natural and architectural imagery, comes into play. We would be happy to supply the pieces to stylishly furnish your showspaces for little or no cost. We only have several small requests, outlined below.

     -  That you mention the furniture was supplied by **** during your presentation of the space.
     -  That you ask those customers who commit to buying one of the spaces whether they would also like to purchase some or all of the furniture on display.
     -  Optionally, that you supply us with professional-quality images that showcase **** pieces in the space. If you supply satisfactory images, **** will furnish (CN)’s showrooms for free as long as images continue to be delivered.

We are pleased and excited about the prospect of beginning this (hopefully) long-term partnership with (CN). Let us know what you think.

Email Marketing, if its done wisely then it can get you very good conversions &amp; help to build your reputation and if its not then it can also destroy your reputation.

Here are some points:

1.Title- Title is very important for any email. Make it good &amp; attractive. But remember in order to make your title catchy don't make any false statement which will be not relevant to your mail content.

2.Mail Length- Your mail open rate may be dependent on your title but your mail CTR will depend basically on the first view of your mail length. Don't make it short (one line or one sentence mail) &amp; also don't make too huge by filling with unnecessary content that will definitely scare your end users.

3.Mail Structure- I personally prefer to divide the mails in three parts, you can also make a maximum length of three paragraphs or to minimum length of three sentences according to your need.

4.Mail Structure: First Part- Dedicate the first part to your clients. Tell them you appreciate their work, tell them how you found them and how you follow them. But remember I am telling to 'appreciate' them not to praise them or worship them. Value your own personality and voice also.

5.Mail Structure: Second Part- Tell them what is the purpose of yours to mail them. Show them kindly your proposal, request for what you need &amp; don't force them in anyway.

6. Mail Structure: Third Part- Ask them politely about their feedbacks. Say them you will be expecting a return message from them. And, also thank them for their time.

198,"14 Ways to Split Test Your Subject Line for a Higher Open RateEmail open rate is important. 

After all, if someone doesn’t open your email, they can’t read it. 

A/B testing your email subject lines is one of the best ways to optimize your email marketing efforts.

But what should you split test?

In today’s post, I’ve compiled 4 subject line split testing ideas for you to try in your next campaign.

But first, a warning.

Email open rate is important, but it’s just one number. If you get a 100% open rate, but no clicks, that’s not a good email.

The easiest way to understand this is that statistically, the best email subject line is no subject line at all.

Sidekick found that emails with no subject line were opened 8% more than the rest.

I don’t recommend sending all your emails with empty subject lines…

When you A/B test, it’s important you measure more than just open rate, ideally a conversion rate as well.

Now on to the tests.

By the end of this post, you’ll over a dozen subject line split test ideas that will keep you busy for months, if not years.

More importantly, these split tests will help you optimize your emails to generate more engagement, traffic, and revenue.

Let’s get to it.

**1. Name vs. No Name**

If you ask for subscribers’ names, try using their names not just in the email body, but in the subject line as well.

MailChimp did an extensive study on email open rates that I’ll be referring to multiple times in this post.

They looked at 24 billion emails across multiple industries and recorded a variety of metrics.

One of their findings was that including any variation of a name improved open rates.

https://i.imgur.com/on8ayLW.png

The most effective name type to include was a first and last name.

Including just the last name was the second best way of personalizing an email in the subject line. Although it’s safe to assume that there was a “Mr.”, “Ms.”, or similar before it.

This is something that Experian Marketing also studied.

They also found that overall, personalization has a positive effect on email open rates. In fact, it helps in almost every industry.

https://i.imgur.com/x3xkQ0t.png

One study found personalization led to an average open rate increase of 29.3%.

Based on the data from MailChimp and Experian, it’s clear that this is an impactful tactic that should be tested when possible.

**Action item:** 

Including someone’s name in the subject line can help grab a reader’s attention and attract clicks. Do a split test where one subject line starts the reader’s name, and one omits it.

For example:

* Here are 14 ways to split test email subject lines
* [Name], Here are 14 ways to split test email subject lines.

**2. First Person vs. Second Person**

For some reason, a lot of the good writing skills that we use to write email bodies and blog posts go out the window when writing a subject line.

Most notably is the lack of first-person language.

No one wants to feel like they receive the same email as thousands of others. We want to feel like the sender put some time and effort into crafting an email that we’d enjoy.

In general, there are Experian Marketing also studied:

The first-person is the most personal grammar perspective, followed by the second person, and then the third person.

At first glance, you might think that using words like “you” (second person) would help the email recipient to see the email more like a conversation.

But the data doesn’t quite support that.

Sidekick found that emails that had “you” in the subject line were opened 5% less than without it.

Optimizely also tested whether first or second person subject lines were better.

They used the following subject lines (bold added for emphasis):

* Control: Are you measuring your tests accurately? Measuring statistical significance of your test
 
* Variation: FAQ: How long should my test run?

The variation using a first-person term easily won, with a 33.9% higher conversion rate (measuring clicks).

That’s clearly just one test, and far from conclusive, but it shows that writing your subject lines with a different perspective can make a big difference.

So, with that in mind, try experimenting between first-person and second person terms.

Here are some first-person words to try:

* I
* We
* Us
* My
* Our
* Me

And here are some (admittedly limited) second person words to try:

* You
* Your
* Yours

**Action item:** 

Using first-person language may help your reader connect more with your subject line. 

Split test two similar emails where one uses first-person language, and the other uses second person language.

For example:

* How should I split test my emails?
* How should you split test your emails?

**3. Urgency vs. No Urgency**

Robert Cialdini included urgency and scarcity as two of the “weapons of influence” in his book, Influence.

Urgency describes any situation where there is a time limitation, while scarcity indicates a limited amount of supply.

In a 2012 study about mobile email trends, Chief Marketer found that email subject lines with a sense of urgency had 22% higher open rates.

Other research since then has confirmed that urgency usually has positive effects on open rates.

In MailChimp’s study, they looked at emails that used the following words:

* Urgent
* Breaking
* Important
* Alert

All four of those words imply time sensitivity and produce urgency.

https://i.imgur.com/F9gHenf.png

All four of those words significantly improved open rates. The best two were “urgent” and “breaking”.

This was also a test that Expedia (the travel company) looked at. 

They found that emails with the word “tomorrow” in the subject line were opened 10% more.

Here are some words and phrases you can think about including in your subject lines to trigger urgency:

* Today only
* Expires tomorrow
* [Urgent]
* One day left
* Only [#] left

Of course, not every email subject line can trigger urgency. So use with caution.

**Action Item:** 

Look for opportunities where you can add urgency triggers to your subject line. Then use them.

For example:

* Download our split testing eBook for free
* Download our split testing eBook for free [today only]

**4. Long Subject Lines vs. Short Subject Lines**

We all know that the length of an email subject line will affect open rates.

The sweet spot is right around 6-10 words in most cases.

https://i.imgur.com/3nFpw9n.png

There are a few reasons why that longer subject lines have lower open rates:

* Display issues on different devices and browsers.
* People skim their emails and long subject lines dilute the main subject.

In 2017, Yes Lifecycle Marketing released an analysis of email open rates by subject length.

They found that no matter what type of email they looked at, email subject lines that were between 1 and 20 characters performed the best.

https://i.imgur.com/YMvZzZk.png

The average English word is 4.5 characters, meaning that subject lines that were between 4-6 words did best.

The research also showed that when you go past 20 characters, sometimes it’s better to have an extra long subject line (61+ characters). 

It depended on the type of email.

**Action Item:** 

There’s no concrete answer about what length is always the best. Try out subject lines that are significantly different lengths, but try to keep the message as similar as possible.

For example:

206,"Top Email Marketing Strategies from Top SaaS CompaniesEmail marketing is still one of the best ways to help market your contents, reach new leads, and make your business known to others. But over the years, email marketing has received some fairly bad raps from annoyed individuals because of the fact that a lot of email marketers in the past abuse this tactic way too much.  
  
An article I have come across before talks about some [simple tips](https://www.smartinsights.com/email-marketing/email-communications-strategy/6-email-marketing-strategy-tips-top-280-saas-companies/) that can help you lay down a solid foundation when it comes to your email marketing strategy and avoid annoying your targets and subscribers.  

**Here is a summary of that article:**

* When they don't reply to the first email, this doesn't mean the end of your effort. For most successful SaaS companies, their email marketing lasts an average of 9 days of constant contact and sending over helpful and highly related contents.

* An average of 23 days follow up before stopping altogether on a combination of voicemails and emails techniques can yield up to 156% of closing a deal rather than just pure email campaigns.

* Avoid annoying your leads by just sending one email per day. In the past, people get annoyed with email marketings and have trouble giving their personal emails because of the fact that email marketers used to abuse this confidence they were given by sending bulk emails full of promotional campaigns. It's not easy navigating through a full inbox looking for some of your important emails. 

* Automate your marketing effort. Automating allows you to attend to other important matters. This way, you can spend enough time writing your campaigns rather than using up all your time hitting send button to individual people or fielding even the smallest and frequently asked questions.

* Use the magic number of email marketing by writing 130 words in your email campaign and make it enough to snag their attention to further click or do whatever it is you want them to do."

210,"Using mailchimp for abandoned cart automation?Is there a way in mailchimp to cookie users who signed up for a newsletter and then notify them incase they abandoned carts? 

Right now it seems they only send abandoned cart to returning customers.

I'm working on a email marketing automation client. We've noticed there's a big difference between actual abandoned carts &amp; ""abandoned cart emails"" we send.

My belief is that this is because mailchimp only cookies users after they made a purchase and create a login. So the abandoned cart are only for returning customers. Which is far from ideal.

I would like to get your thoughts on GDPR:
1) Since our software rides on top of an ESP (e.g. MailChimp), if the subscriber permits the company to track his/her open &amp; click data, then wouldn't that also (by default) include the OK for our analytics data?

219,"CASL and email list management. Help?I'm trying to wrap my head around email list management and CASL compliance. Here's how our business works:

1. Customer books appointment w/ opportunity to opt-in to email marketing

2. If job is complete, customer is on our internal marketing list for up to 2 years (implied consent allows emailing up to 2 years after transaction)

3. When I setup a MailChimp campaign, I export our list as a CSV file. This includes: all customers who've opted in + all customers from last 2 years. This list is then imported to an existing MailChimp list.

When I'm importing this list into the MailChimp list, it only adds/updates existing contacts. If an ""implied consent"" customer is in there from &gt;2 years ago, they're staying in there forever until they unsubscribe. This could be bad news re: CASL, as it's illegal to keep emailing them.

The logical fix is to mass unsubscribe these people by exporting an ""Unsubscribed"" email list from our internal system (of customers &gt;2 years old since last transaction).

The major problem with this:  once I've unsubscribed a contact from MailChimp, they can't be re-subscribed without an explicit double opt-in process. So if that customer uses us again and are back into ""implied consent"" status, we can't email them again. Period.

Is there an easy solution to this? I feel like I have two equally bad options:

1. Risk CASL non-compliance by continuing to email customers who are beyond the 2 year implied consent status
2. Avoid CASL risk but permanently erode my customer list

226,"How to Write a High-Converting Promotional Email (Without Being Salesy)Here’s the scenario. 

You’re an e-commerce store owner looking to promote a product. It might be a brand new product, a seasonal offer or simply an existing product that you want to draw attention to.

Whatever the case, promotional emails are one of the most direct and effective ways to get the word out and drive targeted traffic to your product page.

Studies have even found, “Email had a median ROI of 122 percent—more than four times higher than other marketing formats like social media, direct mail, and paid search.”

But as I’m sure you’re aware, there’s a lot that goes into high-converting promotional emails, and it requires you to follow the right sequence of steps.

These include first ensuring that your email makes it to a subscriber’s inbox, getting them to open it, enticing them with killer copy, getting them to click on your CTA and ultimately making a purchase.

For this post, I’m going to break this process down to the granular level and go over the essential elements of high-converting promotional emails.

Let’s dive right in.

**Campaign Segmentation**

Did you know that segmented email campaigns receive 14.31 percent more opens and 100.95 percent more clicks than non-segmented campaigns?

It’s true.

A 2017 MailChimp study found that segmentation is worth its weight in gold.

https://i.imgur.com/Ui8hZ01.png

The Data &amp; Marketing Association (DMA) even found that email segmentation and personalized email were the most effective email strategies in 2017.

So my first slice of advice is to segment your list and make sure that you’re only sending a promotional email to relevant recipients.

How do you do this?

I suggest examining purchasing behavior, which Constant Contact offers some solid advice on.

&gt; Find out what your audience is interested in by using your email reports to see what they’re opening and clicking on.
&gt; 
&gt; You can save those people to an existing list or create a new one. 
&gt; 
&gt; You can also create lists for customers who purchased a particular product and send them emails about those items.

The way I see it, effective segmentation is a necessary precursor to the rest of the steps in the process.

Even though it will reduce the volume of recipients, you’ll know that the ones who receive an email are high-quality leads and likely to convert.

Plus you won’t annoy other subscribers who probably aren’t interested in a particular product, thus decreasing your unsubscribe rate.

So it’s a win-win.

**1. Use a Clear Sender Name**

The average person is drowning in spam.

In fact, spam accounted for 59.33 percent of total email traffic as of September 2017.

It’s a serious issue.

People are also wary of phishing attacks, which are especially prevalent in the US.

https://i.imgur.com/CStKh3C.jpg

As a result, recipients are more likely than ever to move an email from their inbox to their spam folder if the sender’s identity is even the least bit questionable.

To prevent this from happening to your promotional emails, you need to be sure that recipients are able to instantly recognize your brand.

What’s the best way to do this?

You need to make it crystal clear who the email is from by including your brand name.

Convince &amp; Convert even found, “43 percent of email recipients click the spam button based on the email ‘from’ name or email address.”

And there are two ways to go about this.

One is to simply use your brand name all by itself (e.g. Sleeknote).

The other is to use your brand name along with your personal name (e.g. Emil from Sleeknote).

Here is a great example of SEMrush getting this element just right.

https://i.imgur.com/6SrHQSr.png

Whatever approach you take, just be sure to leave no doubt as to who the email is from so recipients know it’s trustworthy and shouldn’t be flagged as spam.

**2. Create a Rock Solid Subject Line**

You know what else is super important?

The subject line.

Invesp CRO even found, “Nearly half (47 percent) of email recipients open email based on the subject line alone.”

So in theory, a poorly written subject line is going to reduce your open rate by half.

This is why it’s so important to understand the fundamentals of writing an awesome subject line that recipients will respond to.

While there is no be-all end-all technique that works perfectly 100 percent of the time, there are some best practices that you should be aware of.

Here are “the big three.”

**3. Use the Optimal Subject Line Length**

There’s been a lot of debate as to what the ideal subject line length is.

Invesp CRO found that emails with 6-10 words had the highest open rate at 21 percent.

However, a study by Nectafy found that only four words were best.

https://i.imgur.com/M8578BY.png

While the ideal subject line is open to some level of interpretation, one thing is for sure.

You’re likely to see your open rate decline once it exceeds 10 words.

This is simply due to the fact that so many people are using mobile devices to open emails.

In fact, ContactMonkey found, “40 percent of emails are first opened on a mobile device where the screen can only fit 4-7 words across the screen.

So if you’re going over 10 words, there’s no way the entire subject line will be visible for mobile users.

And when you consider the fact that mobile device use is trending up and desktop use is trending down, it’s clear that you want to write subject lines with mobile users in mind.

https://i.imgur.com/NAjZ1Me.png

So my advice is to keep your subject lines fairly brief with 4-7 words usually being the sweet spot.

Here’s a nice example of short subject lines in action and what they look like for mobile users.

https://i.imgur.com/y599CeO.png

**4. Personalize the Subject Line**

As I mentioned before when I discussed email segmentation, personalization plays a huge role in how well promotional emails perform.

Research from Campaign Monitor reiterates this fact.

According to them, “Emails with personalized subject lines are 26 percent more likely to be opened.”

https://i.imgur.com/XPQ3Mbt.png

So it should be worth the effort to address each recipient by name.

**5. Avoid Spammy Words**

Another mistake that can sabotage your strategy is using spammy words in the subject line.

I’m sure you’ve received emails like these before.

https://i.imgur.com/9FeYGYi.png

They’re terrible, and one quick glance lets you know that they’re complete spam that should never see the light of day.

While you would never intentionally use subject lines like these, you may unintentionally use spammy words.

Here are some examples:

https://i.imgur.com/ihOomRi.png

This is problematic for two reasons.

First, spammy words greatly increase the chances of a recipient’s ISP filtering out your email and sending it spam.

So it may never even make it to their inbox in the first place.

Second, they increase the chances of recipients flagging it as spam.

Therefore, it’s critical to familiarize yourself with spammy words and avoid using them at all costs.

If you follow this basic formula when creating your subject line, you should be in good shape.

Now let’s get into the nitty-gritty of promotional emails—the copy itself.

**6. Write Compelling Copy**

At this point, you should have taken the necessary steps to increase your open rate.

Now you need to take the next step and write compelling copy so that your message actually gets read.

More importantly, you need to grab the reader’s attention and motivate them to take action.

So how exactly do you do this?

My first bit of advice is to not follow a rigid structure with your emails.

While you’ll want to follow a logical format, you don’t want your emails to be so predictable that they bore your readers to tears.

That’s why I like to make the writing process as organic as possible and to mix it up.

Next, I suggest using a natural voice.

What do I mean by this?

I mean writing in a conversational tone like you’re speaking with your readers directly.

That’s actually something that I try to do with my writing in general (including this post).

I’ve found that it facilitates smooth communication and should give your writing a sense of warmth.

In other words, try to avoid coming across as robotic like you’re some faceless entity that’s solely bent on promotion.

Of course, you’re there to promote your products or services, but you’re also there to build relationships.

Offerman WoodShop does a great job at this with their email promoting wood coasters.

https://i.imgur.com/NmIMEeY.png

I also recommend keeping your copy fairly short.

The last thing that people want to do is navigate their way through some long-winded, labyrinthine email that takes a chunk of time out of their day.

Just get to the point as quickly as possible, and edit your copy with an iron fist.

Always go back and see if there’s any text that could be removed before pressing send.

I think that Bluefly does this well with their email asking subscribers to take a survey.

https://i.imgur.com/QKXpWqS.png

**7. Sell Without Being Salesy**

Remember that most email marketing campaigns involve playing the long game.

It’s all about nurturing your leads, gradually building trust and rapport and strengthening relationships.

If you go for the jugular right off the bat and take a “BUY NOW!” approach, you’ll almost always squander leads, and many will people will unsubscribe.

A better approach is to sell without being salesy.

In other words, promote your products but don’t be obnoxious about.

Use tact and be thoughtful about your audience’s needs and wants.

I like what the Enchanting Marketing team has to say about this:

&gt; Dirty sales tactics are designed for selling to strangers. 
&gt; 
&gt; Treat your buyers like friends. 
&gt; 
&gt; Be genuine. 
&gt; 
&gt; Be helpful. 
&gt; 
&gt; Be lovable. 
&gt; 
&gt; Make their life better.

This is a great mindset to have when approaching your copy.

When your primary focus is helping people rather than going for the immediate sale, the odds of making a sale actually increase.

Take this email from Dropbox for example.

https://i.imgur.com/O4INpbW.png

Rather than pounding recipients over the head, it simply lists some ways that Dropbox can simplify their lives.

So stop trying so hard and the pieces will usually fall into place.

**8. Write Scannable Copy**

If you’ve been doing any type of content marketing for any length of time, you probably know that readers seldom read anything in its entirety.

Whether it’s a long-form blog post, a whitepaper or an email, the majority of folks just scan.

By building your content around this innate desire to scan, your emails will be in a better position to convert.

So rather than writing some long-winded monstrosity with huge blocks of text, simplify things by breaking your content into smaller, more manageable blocks of text that can be easily digested.
Here’s a good example of an email I recently received from SEMRush.
https://i.imgur.com/DDWTnQk.png

**9. Use Images**

You also probably know just how big visuals are in content marketing.

Social Media Examiner even reports, “37 percent of marketers say visual marketing was the most important form of content for their business, second only to blogging.”

So it’s understandable how providing subscribers with a bit of eye candy is one of the best ways to get their attention and motivate them to buy a product.

This is why I highly recommend incorporating images into your promotional emails.

There’s just one question. How many images should you use in an email?

According to research from 37 percent of marketers, “Click-through rates are highest in emails with three or fewer images.”

https://i.imgur.com/7frSfc8.jpg

And I feel like that’s a pretty reasonable number.

One to three images should give your email a splash of eye appeal but shouldn’t overwhelm recipients with excessive visuals stimuli.

Shopify pulls this off flawlessly with this email.

https://i.imgur.com/j08VOaw.jpg

If you’re looking for some inspiration and ideas, check out our post on e-commerce email marketing that offers some great examples of emails with beautiful design and images.

**10. Optimize the CTA**

At this point, you should have done everything within your power to maximize the number of recipients who open your email and look over your offer.

Now it’s time to go for the kill.

While the main intention of many emails is to simply nurture leads and increase brand awareness, promotional emails are used to make a sale.

Consequently, you need to have a fully optimized CTA that gets the maximum percentage of recipients to click through to the product page (and hopefully buy).

Here are some things that I would consider best practices for CTA optimization:

* Use a CTA button. There’s just something more eye appealing about a button rather than a link. Campaign Monitor even found that using a button-based CTA increased click-through rates by 28 percent over a link-based CTA.
 
* Use a contrasting color. It’s critical that a CTA is able to stand out from the rest of your copy. One of the easiest ways to accomplish this is to use a contrasting color. Campaign Monitor makes the point that “green and orange buttons are said to perform best, but your button colors will depend on your brand.”
 
* Have negative space around your CTA. It’s also wise to use a healthy amount of negative space to create a visual break and make your CTA easier to find.
 
* Make the offer time-sensitive. If you don’t get a recipient to convert right away, there’s a good chance that they’ll never convert (at least for that particular product). Making your CTA time-sensitive by using words like “now” and “today” increases their odds of taking action right then and there.
 
* Give it a 3D look. Now, this may be splitting hairs, but any advantage you can gain is a good thing. Another way to increase your click-through rate is to make your CTA more “clickable.” By this, I mean making it look like it should be clicked, which can be done by using a bit of a shadow around the edges of a button to give it a 3D appearance.

Now for a couple of examples.

Here’s one from author and entrepreneur, Marie Forleo:

https://i.imgur.com/D4HlfCF.png

Notice that she uses an attractive button with plenty of contrast and negative space surrounding it.

Here’s one from MailChimp that incorporates the same concepts.

https://i.imgur.com/DcBmkDE.jpg

Notice just above the button, they indicate that the offer is time sensitive with course registration nearing its end.

**Conclusion**

How has email managed to maintain its position at the top of the digital marketing hierarchy for all this time?

It’s simple. People habitually check their inbox each and every day.

In fact, “More than half (52.7 percent) of individuals surveyed in the US check their personal email account more than 10 times a day, and it is by far their favorite way to receive communication from brands.”

I know that I’m personally guilty of checking my email way too often at times.

So if you’re looking to promote a particular product, this is one of the best ways to do it.

Reaching out to subscribers is ideal because they’ve already demonstrated some level of interest in your brand.

It’s especially potent when emailing subscribers who have already purchased from you in the past.

But as you just found out, there’s a lot that goes into high-converting promotional emails.

My logic is to start from the top (e.g. segmenting your list and making sure your email doesn’t get sent to spam) and work your way to the bottom (e.g. fine-tuning the copy and optimizing the CTA).

I’ve found that working through the process systematically like this allows you to cover all of the bases so that you inevitably end up with an email that’s poised to convert.

By focusing on the essential elements listed here, you should be able to take your promotional emails further and crank up your conversion rate.

231,"Name Field on Pop-Ups. To Use or Not to Use?What do you guys think is better?

I have two direct links that lead customers to both google and facebook that I would like to send.  In the email I would like to have a thumbs-up icon and also a thumbs-down icon and if they hit the thumbs down they are taken to a place to reply and if thumbs-up it opens both direct links.

233,"Embed forms for Groups inside a Master list in MailchimpHey there!

I have a Mailchimp question, hopefully you guys could help me out with it!

In our marketing team, we're focusing on generating leads through different content campaigns, like ebooks, email courses, etc. While that works great, the problem is that we're starting to have too many lists in Mailchimp, for each separate campaign that we're doing. 

That leads to another problem: duplicates. 

I read this article on Mailchimp FAQ that you can combine all your lists to one Master List, and then set up Groups in that Master list. However, it remains unclear to me how to associate an embed/subscription form to a particular Group in the Master List? Is that even possible?

What I basically want to have is a unique landing page for all my ebooks, and a unique Mailchimp  embed form on each page. And then a new subscriber would go into the Master List, but Mailchimp would put him in the specific Group for that Specific Ebook that he downloaded -- does this make sense? Do you know how to do this?

Would really appreciate your help, thanks so much!"

Really prefer a course as I find they are concise and separate the wheat from the chaff; they are much more efficient than reading blog posts or trying to learn it on your own.

26,"Business - Synchronize company contacts group with anotherHi,

Sorry this will be a bit of a long one to get the explanation across.

We use Outlook and have an outsourced IT department.

The long story is...in the company I work for we have groups for each department.

for example purchasing has 5 employees, and sales email them every time stock is booked out. However we have an issue of 2 existing groups. To cut that short, basically miscommunication and new staffing lead to two groups existing for one department. 

Some sales staff use the wrong one (OLD ONE) and therefore emails get missed and have been advised to use the 'new' one. 

The 'OLD' purchasing email group is easier to access, **TO &gt; PURCHASING**  after that, just typing 'P' brings it up.

But the majority is now used to using the 'NEW' group which is found via **To &gt; company contacts &gt; 001 Purchase**

The IT have suggested deleting the **The New one** and forcing everyone to use the old one again as its easier to access which in theory is fine. But it means once again shifting all of 300+ employees of other departments to use another group. (after only just recently pushing them onto the new one might  I add)

As a purchasing employee i'm going to suggest merging the groups so that if you use either new or old, it filters through to the correct list of employees in purchasing. Is this possible?

Its mainly to avoid the frustration caused from messing all the employees around switching groups all the time

Thanks for your time :)"

I hated it was Gmail accounts only. So I was using apple mail for my iCloud account. And then regular Gmail for my work account.

51,"Mac Mail - Signature - Image wrapping when attachingHere's the scaled down version of my question:

If you create a new signature in mac mail and drag in two images side by side, save it, and use that as your signature (I have to drag the signature onto 'exchange', not sure if that matters) then write a new email to yourself, it looks fine.  If you write a new email and add an attachment, it looks fine, but when you receive it you'll note that the images have wrapped to each be on a new line.

That's the core of it... more info...

I was trying to make a custom HTML signature by creating it as HTML, then making a new one in Mail, quitting out of Mail, finding the signature, replacing it's contents with my HTML, locking the file, opening Mail again... which works but gave me the same image issue as above - fine for new message, but with attachment suddenly the whole thing looks like it gets re-written - my signature is one big HTML table but what comes through the other end when you look at the raw source is html that has been broken out into other peices.

I tried various suggestions (preferring embedded images) for images using cid references, inline data base64 right on the img src property and they all had their issues.  Embedding with the span/object tag that Mail uses seemed to be the best way to do it, until I tried an attachment.

I looked into wrapping my multipart/related part in a multipart/mixed or other multipart structures, thinking I could stop the end result from breaking it up, but it seems that Mail didn't like that, everything I tried resulted in seeing nothing for that signature in Mail.

Anyway, seems more work than it should be, I wouldn't think I need to re-invent the wheel here!

Thanks!"
52,How do you handle email bounce backs with personalized subjects?How do you handle email bouncebacks with personalized subjects? We send bulk emails to thousands of clients daily. Currently we run a script that combs our inbox and places all emails with the same subject into various folders that match our SQL database. This works great until a personalized email subject is sent. Because these emails all have unique subjects our script ignores these emails. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to handle this? We can't always say ignore the first part of the email because what if the personalized part comes in the middle of the subject. We thought about passing a unique code into the subject that would be hidden...but this doesn't seem to work across all email clients. Any thoughts or suggestions would be really appreciated.

I hope this is the correct sub for this kind of question.

A few days ago I saw in a routine blacklist check that the external IP of my KVM host is blacklisted by jippg.org

This hypervisor also runs my mailserver so not really optimal. Now I have checked for hours on every VM that could somehow send mail over that IP but I didn't find anything suspicious. The statistics mails on my mailserver don't show any significant rise in mail activity, either.

The mailserver sends maybe 20-30 mails a day so no chance of accidental spam.

Now after investigating I've tried to contact removals@blacklist.jippg.org but didn't receive an answer.

Is there anything I can do? I'm not banned on any other blacklist, just jippg.org

As this also functions as a partial work email when I am at home, it makes it hard to deal with clients as I am basically fishing through a sea of spam to find the actual emails I want.

Did something happen to hotmail's spam filters recently that all the spam is being diverted to my email rather than spam folder?"

106,"One eMail client for mobile and osxI used an Apple Mac until about a year ago when I switched to windows. The switch has been great but the only thing I really miss is Apple Mail. I was a really big fan of having a single message client where all my mail, both business and personal, was centralized and updated whether I tended to my accounts on my mobile or my desktop/laptop. 

Since switching to windows, I've switched my client to Gmail, but I'm not a fan of the interface. I've also found that my email accounts on mobile and browser don't sync at the same time/speed. I've tried Mozilla Thunderbird and I LOVE it, but again, it's desktop only. I tried the outlook browser client, but never got it to sync properly with my go-daddy email accounts, and I'm not paying for a Microsoft Office membership just to use the desktop client, I've transferred all my MS Office needs to Google Docs.

Reason: 554 5.7.1 Rejected xxx.xxx.xxx.xx found in spamlist
Barracudacentral.org


There is a customer that is trying to send email to a client of mine but is saying her emails are bouncing back with the above error.  The customer has also tried to send me an email and it has also bounced back.  My client and I are not having any trouble with sending emails.  We apparently are not receiving the customers.

The customer has her email hosted on the xxx.xxx.xxx.xx IP address. The xxx.xxx.xxx.xx address is listed in 4 blacklists according to mxtoolbox.com

To me, it sounds like the customer is the cause of the delivery failure although it looks like it is her own system kicking back the email.   Is the “xxx.xxx.xxx.xx found in spamlist” the proof it is the customer and not my clients' issue?

If it was my client's fault with being on a blacklist, shouldn’t the error message be:

After one month of futile arguing with their tech support, I thought I had enough and just stopped talking to them and using their service. This made me lose years of digital life though, so I'm very, very, very angry. I have saved my address book, I feel like a digital migrant and now I'm looking for another place to start over. So what I'm looking for is an email provider that is:

- free (as in free beer) and will stay so forever
- old enough to be here to stay for years to come
- doesn't enforce bullshit like real names in account profile or mandatory linking of email accounts to phone numbers and it's unlikely for it to do so in the future
- reasonable mailbox and attachment size, so it won't choke if I'd need to send a 1MB file as attachment
- Tor/TorBrowser friendly, so it must not use the ebola of the world wide web that CloudFlare is

Looking for as many suggestions as possible, because this time I'm going to contact their support before I'll decide to go for it and ask them to explicitly answer the above questions. Thanks."
153,"E-Mail client (or add-on) with advanced archiving skillsI'm using [Postbox](https://www.postbox-inc.com/) on Mac since years (not the newest version ATM) because it has this little feature: you can press **g** on your keyboard and a search window pops up where you can type any part of a foldername and then choose from the dropdown to jump into that folder. If you press **v* the same window appears but this time the currently selected message will be moved into the choosen folder. That saves a lot of time because you don't need to scroll in your folders list and drag'n'drop your messages.

I also love the iOS Mail-App because if you choose ""Move"" for a mail it gives you to options: **Move to ""XYZ""** where XYZ is the folder you moved a mail from this sender last time and **Move to other folder** for choosing one.

I miss the iOS-Feature on a desktop client because if i'm doing archiving maybe once a week i need to search 10-20 folders over and over. I just would like to press something like a button to archive the mail I'm currently seeing to the folder I'm archiving them usually (like everything from info@eat.ch goes into ""Order food online"").

- When replying, all members of the group should see the reply.

That's really all of it. If you can use your existing email to do it then that's a great bonus, but a login to another website/email is fine too. 

With googlegroups I keep running into inconsistencies to where the replies are actually sent. If you use the web view the original sender doesn't get it. But if you subscribe to notifications and reply from your gmail account you can choose recepients. Problem is there are 2 ways replies won't be seen by other members: user forgets to use ""reply to all"", or uses the web view to reply. Not ideal for non tech-savvy...

I'm self employed, and the business I run depends mainly on people finding and contacting us through our website. Unfortunately sometimes I get complaints that my emails are ending up in their Spam accounts, or when they reply sometimes the subject is changed to ****SPAM**** which looks anything but professional :(

I went to add my own email to our new email marketing website, and it said it was blacklisted - I couldn't even deliver my own marketing emails to myself!

Do you have any tips as to how to get round this?

Some reasons I think it is happening:

The main one - stupidly when I was starting up (about 5 years ago) I had no idea how things work and scraped a load of emails of businesses I thought I could work with, then bulk emailed them from this current email account.

Possible others - I email from gmail, but have it set up that I can either email from my gmail account or make it seem that it is coming from my domain - which is what I normally do. I don't actually pay for any email hosting/usage I just have a few @domain.co.uk emails which are forwarded into my gmail account - Is this bad?

I own both the .co.uk and .org domains for my site - it is just the .co.uk which is being listed as spam, and in particular the info@domain.co.uk which I use all the time.

I work for a small company that runs events for big and small companies, we want to switch from Mailchimp to another service.

The problem we have with Mailchimp is that, every time I want to send an email on the clients behalf (i.e. steve.jones@fox.com) , the “from” address looks weird:
steve.jones=fox.com@mail82.atl31.mcdlv....

This is because the domain is verified for sending but NOT authenticated.

In order to authenticate it, the IT department of each of our clients has to authenticate by modifying the domain's DNS records. Some smaller clients are willing to do so.

As you may understand, this is NOT possible with the bigger clients, mainly because the client does not want to be bothered with that.

I have reached out to Send grid and unfortunately it works the same with them.
So my question to you is:

Which email service (preferably with Word press integration) will allow me to send emails on the client's behalf without the problem I am experiencing now?"

239,"Custom email address service?This isn't how email is intended to work but hear me out. Is there a service with some domain name, x.com for example, that lets me create an account with a subdomain of my choosing. For example, paul.x.com, would be my account and then it would allow me to quickly create custom email addresses.

So for example, once I went through the setup, I would have the email paul@paul.x.com by default and I could check my emails by going to the x.com web client and logging in. But say I wanted to create an email specifically for newsletters, I could easily create news@paul.x.com or maybe bike@paul.x.com if I were selling my bike and wanted to give out an email specifically for that.

-----

I could turn off an address at any time if it became spammed and each email address I gave out would end up as a kind of self-sorting system to keep all my emails properly sorted. Some people already do this with work and personal emails but I'd like to be able to add a new address with very little effort.

Right now i'm using Mailgun to send those e-mail, but the problem is that my e-mails are being delivered, but at the first time an notification is sent to a user automatically goes to spam list (trash list) of this e-mail. 

So my doubt is, this is a ESP problem or this can be the content of my e-mail notification? How can i fix this?

257,"My Golden Rules to Email ManagementA challenge of our time is freeing up the time to do greater things in our lives that are purposeful and fulfilling.

Sometimes you get this feeling that you want to escape from behind the desk that you feel shackled to. 

The average person receives about 126 emails per day, and only 77 are really legitimate. There is a way to process through this daily assault of emails.

*""Veni, Vidi, Vici"" is the phrase I try to keep in mind when I handle email. It means ""I came, I saw, I conquered.""*

Here is how to unlock hours of email processing. 

If you are going spend longer than two minutes processing an email, then put it in a folder to process later. When you first sit down, itemize and process your emails into as few folders as possible from most important to least important.


**For example, I created 3 folders.**

1.) Email that requires a response that lasts longer than two minutes to draft.

2.) A folder where I can store things that do not need answers but are waiting for something to happen first. Much like thinking about the concept of IFTTT (If this...then that...).

3.) A folder for archive items that are valuable and may be referenced later.


**Change your mindset and change your behavior.**

* The average person types 38-40 words per minute.
* Sentences are composed of 8-11 words for easy reading. 
* Using these numbers equates to 7-10 sentences per 2 minutes. 
* Effective communication in most emails is 7-10 sentences.

Cut out the unnecessary fatty parts of the email and get to the point. 

Take Twitters approach. They limit tweets to 140 characters.


Use 7-10 sentences and convey your thoughts in a clear, concise and to the point manner.


**Be a leader through email.**

Respect the receiver by presenting a prompt, clear, concise and easy-to-read email. Your target is to keep time to a minimum in your email program so you can work on what is important."

The client I wrote on behalf of, said that it was 'inappropriate', 'unprofessional', and quote: 'You ""emphasize that I am a female speaker"" and that ""I am just asking a small favor just hear me out a bit"" - instead of us simply saying we are asking for something without needing to put extra ""please"".

The generation of the HTML works fine and I can load the HTML into chrome and it displays 100% correctly.

I would prefer to not have to host these images somewhere at the moment and would like them to be embedded in the e-mail.  We can achieve this by using outlook on each individuals machine to create the signature by hand, but again we want to avoid that.  Ideally, we will generate these templates and then automatically put these files on each employee's computer so all we have to do is select the signature from outlook.

The problem we are having is that when we do this, the image does not load.  It seems that outlook won't allow base64 encoded images?  I've tried to work around this by trying to attach the image to the email and then referencing it, but this doesn't seem to work either.

We have been using a basic POP server provided by our web host for many years, which gives the basic functionality but is really outdated, with limited space and very poor spam filter.

(Final note: I considered uploading the PSD Email template here, but there is a little too much on there that is doxable. It contains several fields which will need to be edited each time the send out the template, and social media icon hyperlinking).

293,"Antagonist sends email addressed to me, and CC's a few other people; I did not receive it.I have a vendor with whom I had a recent dispute.  I complained directly and only to that vendor about poor service.  

The vendor shortly sent a critical (of me) email to me, and CC'ed a few others.  One of the others called me and asked what was happening.  I told her I did not see the email and she then forwarded me a copy.

I regularly receive emails from the sender, so I am not unknowingly blocking the sender's address.  Is it possible the sender did something intentionally to make it look like I was the ""to"" addressee (I showed as such on the forwarded copy, and my email address seemed correct), but was intentionally kept from receiving the message?

Is there a better subreddit for this question?

Greetings everyone,

Thank you for your past and future support of Unseen.  It’s because of your commitment to private and secure communications that we’ve kept our service running since 2011 and we hope to continue to provide this service for years to come.

A couple of things have changed on the internet; we’ve noticed it’s becoming more difficult for our users to connect to centralized services and we’ve also had a lot of abuse of our free accounts. To remedy these issues we are doing the following:

-Unseen, ehf is converting to a non-profit company (project) structure, it’s just not possible to run an honest service without severe interference from various entities. It will be a project staffed by volunteers and you are welcome to contribute or donate, too!  

-Effective immediately there will no new free accounts.  If you currently have a free account, you will have until September 15th to upgrade to premium or get some FLASH coins for your account and we will end the free accounts at that time.  We will have more information about the status of free accounts in the next week or two. If you can’t afford a premium account or if you feel that you qualify for a free premium account (you are a member of a persecuted group like Falun Gong meditators, oppose repressive regimes, journalist, etc), please contact support. We had so much abuse from the free accounts, it’s not fair for our staff or the Advania data center team in Iceland to continue to deal with this. We’re very sorry we have to do this.

-We will be developing a true p2p infrastructure, based on open source for chat and calling.  This will potentially include our vpn service.   

-We will be powering things with crypto coin technology using FLASH coins ( LINK REMOVED) and we will be receiving a donation of coins from them to support our efforts and our premium users.  

More info can be found in the survey, we hope you can take the time to complete it for us:

To thank everyone for completing the survey, we have a special coupon code to save on a premium upgrade at the end of the survey.

Best always,

317,"Forwarding emails and DKIM/SPF/DMARC - what's correct?I have a domain and set up email forwards for each and every service I sign up for. So for an account on example.org, that would be `example.org@mydomain.com` which is then forwarded to my gmail address. This way, I can easily delete aliases when spam starts to arrive and also know which service had a breach or sold my info.

However, I recently noticed a problem with mails from a specific sender: Deutsche Post, dhl.de.

Those mails just didn't show up in my Gmail account at all, not even in the Spam folder. They don't have a DKIM signature, but there are SPF and DMARC rules defined. Some troubleshooting later, it was clear that the Google server rejected the mail due to a failing DMARC check:

    550-5.7.1 Unauthenticated email from dhl.de is not accepted due to domain's
    550-5.7.1 DMARC policy. Please contact the administrator of dhl.de domain if
    550-5.7.1 this was a legitimate mail. Please visit
    550-5.7.1  https://support.google.com/mail/answer/2451690 to learn about the
    550 5.7.1 DMARC initiative. q13si2966659wra.187 - gsmtp

I now spent the last two days reading about SPF, DKIM and DMARC. And a thing called SRS -
 Sender Rewriting Scheme. SRS defines the recommended way to change the envelope sender to something from my own domain, so that the SPF check succeeds.

However, when changing the envelope sender to be different than the header sender (the `From:` header you see in the mail client), that causes the DMARC ""alignment"" check to fail. Which in turn gets the mail rejected again.

So basically:

1. Forward the mail as-is: DMARC fails because SPF fails - mail is rejected.
1. Rewrite envelope sender using SRS: DMARC fails because envelope and headers are not aligned

The only working way I found for now is to rewrite the `From:`-header, too. But this means losing the real sender info so subsequent filters in the mail client are harder to implement. Also this doesn't look nice at all when the sender suddenly is `SRS0=ABCD=12=dhl.de=noreply.kundenkonto@mydomain.com` (with `ABCD` and `12` being checksum and timestamp - so constantly changing).

Is there any other/better approach? Or is this probably even a misconfiguration on dhl.de?"

350,"Inexpensive email host?Long story short, a couple family members have their own domain -- primarily for e-mail -- hosted through GoDaddy.  They're both using Outlook, configured for POP3, even though GoDaddy supports IMAP.

My problem is at 7.99/mo for the accounts I feel like it's too much money.  Curious what others may be using for a more economical email provider.  Would love IMAP access, and being able to set up forwarding addresses or aliases would be nice to have but not required.

G Suite for the two accounts would be roughly break-even, but would include way too many features they'd never touch.

Not sure if there's an O365 option that's email only.  One of them has a 365 subscription for the Office apps that they share with the other person, so not sure if already having a subscription would cause any problems, or if it'd be cheaper to add e-mail to that subscription or what.

Or maybe there's another POP3/IMAP provider that's cheaper than GoDaddy?

IMAP or Exchange/O365 is attractive to me because I feel a little dirty that they both have smartphones with no e-mail setup on them.  For one it might be a little more important than the other, and trying to setup the POP3 ""leave messages on server"" setting and explain how that all works to them is way more trouble than its worth. :)

Reason I ask, I'd like for everyone to use a more modern email platform that's quick and easy to use via the cloud. That way the emails can also be setup with a google drive account for storage and to keep all files on the cloud at the same time.

383,"Drip or ConvertKit?Hey /r/email :) 

I am currently using Mailchimp for my personal list, because I don't have anything too complicated going on. Just some basic workflows for welcoming, announcements about blog posts. 

I write a blog, and in the future I'm looking to get into the individual content upgrades per blog post type of lead generation. 

So I am thinking of switching email services to make the distribution of that easier. 

Do you use one of those, how do you like it? Have you switched from one to the other - what are your thoughts? 

What I liked from my research about ConvertKit was that you could select individual opt-in forms and easily tie them to distributing PDFs. It seemed very simple to manage in the UI what my system will wind up looking like: Several automation workflows, many different 1 off deliveries of PDFs from different optin forms across my blog posts, and managing automated courses (like if it was a several day email course or something) ***on top of*** plain old email blasts about the blog posts. 

I also liked that ConvertKit seemed to be built with a squeeze page generation functionality. 

But I also wanted to compare it with something else for good measure, I have heard good things about Drip but I don't know as much about it. But it seemed like people looking to do what I am going to do choose both of these providers.

I don't want to get Infusionsoft or anything complicated. I am considering moving to a more serious platform like that when I have 5,000 subscribers... 

So what are your thoughts?"

385,"One Way Valve/ Email Batch Importation from WWW to Air Gapped IntranetHello, working in a sensitive environment which requires a totally air-gapped intranet.

We have open source encrypted email (in www), as well as Microsoft Exchange driven email in our intranet (air-gapped).

I am trying to propose a solution where we can do a one-way push of emails from WWW to our intranet. It is almost impossible for me to convince the security people (they have the authority but often lacks the expertise to do reasonable ruling - their favourite approach is to say no to everything) that we can plug these together with a one-way sync (I know there's commercial products out there).

The method we are exploring now is - having a dedicated email account in the WWW (e.g. entrypoint@companyname.com) where people can forward emails, where these emails will be retrieved at a particular workstation, run through all sort of virus and malware check, and then mass import into the intranet's email system. 

We are currently trying to sync and make sure every email account in the WWW environment has an equivalent in the intranet, e.g. Steve Jobs will have steve.jobs@mycompanyname.com; and in the intranet (since we don't have to pay for domain in the intranet), it will be steve.jobs@mycompanyname.int, for example.

I am thinking once we are done with that, if people wanted to get a file from internet into intranet, he/she will just email the attachment to him/herself (steve.jobs@mycompanyname.com), and BCC entrypoint@ourcompanyname.com). At fixed interval or time every day (during working hours, e.g. every 30 mins or 1 hour or as per required), someone will login to entrypoint@ourcompanyname.com, manually batch download all these emails with all the attributes and attachments in tack, and import them into the intranet Microsoft Exchange. So send our the emails, we can do a transformation on the attributes to change the .com to .int as well.

This is just a hypothetical approach and I am wondering if you guys have done something like this and what's your recommendation?"

I'm looking to get started with Co-Reg mailing.

I have previous experience with servers - I use to run my own hosting company. I have also promoted CPA offers in the past, so I'm no stranger to the industry, just the infastructure needed for Coregistration mailing.

I have a Dedi server I can use for PowerMTA, and a seperate server for Interspire, for my target amount of emails per day it would be difficult to use a VPS.

I don't plan to warm up my own IP's, I was hoping to use a shared mailing service like Amazon (as the reputation of the IP's would be in good standing).

My questions are:

1. Does Amazon/Sendgrid allow Co-reg emails? They are opt-in and therefore canspam compliant.
2. Would I get banned from Amazon quickly for mailing co-reg data?

If anyone out there is also into this type of mailing, feel free to hit me up. I'm serious about doing this, and would be open to sharing ideas.

* Should I sort by action? (To do, Read only, Snoozed...)
* What if someone mentions two different projects in the same email? 
* How to sort the replies to that same email? Should I apply the project label to them or another label ?

402,"Using hosting provided email? A bad idea?I tried figuring this out looking through r/webhosting but it soon gets bogged down with high-level technical talk to where my eyes glaze over and I can't process information.

I'm helping out some people - they have a domain registered via GoDaddy, and want to add more email addresses. I told them paying $60 per email was outrageous. They're putting up a website soon - is there a reason I shouldn't just get them some hosting, setup emails in cpanel and then route them through gmail accounts (they like the interface) and set up the aliasing so it all looks like it's name@domain? I've done this for other domains I've run, but they've all been very low volume. This would be for a small business. 

Additionally, their current email is in office365 - would there be a way to transfer that email over to whichever new service I set them up with? Would hate to have to have a big start and stop for them and old emails inaccessible. 

Thanks."
403,"Buying custom domain and custom emails.Hello,

I'm looking at setting up a new website for a charity and then getting staff a custom email.

I know there are lots of places where you can buy a web domain, I also know there are lots of them that allow you to set up emails too, however these are a monthly cost, which can't be afforded.

Also, as a registered charity (in the UK), they are entitled to free and discounted software - such as google for non-profits; which I think includes some sort of email hosting?


So if anyone could help me with the following, presuming they buy a domain:

* Is it possible for the charity to host custom emails for free, as they're a charity?
* Is there only certain domain providers which are ""compatible""?
* How hard/time consuming would setting it up be?
* What would the maintenance time be?
* Would it be easy to add/remove users/emails later on down the line?
* Would the emails be able to be integrated with Microsoft Office (and outlook) if an office package was purchased for each user?

All/any help is massively appreciated, thanks for reading!"

I'm not sure this is the right place to ask, or if this has been asked before. But anyway:

My family had a private email server that a few members still use. This server got sold with the family buissnes with the condition that we will still be able to use our email addresses indefinitely. But since the owners of the server are apparently not interested in using this server for email, they didn't update the spam filter in forever (or maybe they even disabled it, I don't know). 

I'm getting around 100 spam mails per day now, (the other users don't have that much trouble) which is really annoying, especially because it swamps the notifications on my phone. I don't even read mails daily anymore because it's just such of a hasstle to sort through all the spam.

I thought about migrating all my accounts and such to gmail but this is way too much trouble since this address is my main contact address people use and it's listed on a few websites as my contact.

Immediately after my main email account (which is linked to the PayPal account) began to receive a ridiculous amount of spam (~5000 junk email in two hours).

I have since had the PayPal transactions reversed and my eBay account recovered, however I'm now left with the issue of my main email account (which has been for 10+ years) being completely obliterated by the junk mail. I never received any form of junk mail beforehand as I was very cautious of where I used this email and now I'm clueless on how to resolve this while more spam email is pouring in by the minute. It's easy to say I should create a new email but I literally have too many services linked to my email to warrant a smooth transition and to be honest the email account has sentimental value and I only want this to be the very last option.

439,"Email service that works in phases, based off connections.Please bare with me, first time trying this out; and if this is not the right place can some one point me in the right direction. 

I run a service based business that deals with project managers, property managers, and individual tenants. I am looking to take over scheduling directly with the tenants, while taking the work load off of the property manager.  Normally If I need to perform work in a specific tenant, I would email the property manager a prospective date, and he would then email the tenant, and then get back to me, and this goes back and forth depending on availability. After that, the property management would need to send out notices, and instructions etc. Not too bad but what I am trying to do is take the workload off of the property manager, while still involving them. 

Service I am looking for:

I would like to email the property manager a prospective date to begin work. He would have (3) options. Agree, decline, or propose another date. 

Accept: When the date is accepted, a tenant notification/flyer that we would supply is sent to each tenant on the property managements behalf, and work can begin on said date. 

Decline: If the date is declined project manager can then be in contact as to why it was declined, and problem solve how to move forward. 

Propose new date: If the property manager would like to propose a new date, it would kick back to the project manager (me), and after i accept it based on available days , it would then notify the tenants with the flyer or instructions. 

This whole thing would be based off of connections. A building (tenants), who has a dedicated property manager, who has a vendor (me)   

I don't know if this can be done with plain old email or if an app needs to be developed, or what. But if anyone has an idea, that would be killer.

446,"[OPEN QUESTION] Full Inbox for Addresses I'm ForwardingI recently set up a new Google account since I was starting a new digital life (personal story). I want to be able to receive emails from my old accounts (Outlook and Gmail). In Outlook, I set up rules to forward to my new address, and in Gmail, I set up a forwarding address.

Question: *What will happen if the inboxes of my old accounts fill up?* I won't be there to delete the emails since I'm forwarding them. I'm also fearful of setting up emails in the accounts I'm forwarding to delete after forwarding (aka what if something goes wrong and they delete but never forward)."

448,Setting up a filter for emails from colleges?I have been getting a lot of emails from colleges and am not sure how to set up a good filter. I can't do it by .Edu since that will filter out emails from my HS. Subject wouldn't work since they vary so much. Words included wouldn't do a very good job since it would filter any email that contains the word college. The only way that I can think of would be adding each individual college email which would be a big hassle. Any advice on the best way to filter college emails?

455,"Is there a way to automate out of office email replies for non-business hours? (Site5/cpanel/ or other)?[OPEN QUESTION] 
Hi, I'm trying to find a way that will allow our email accounts to have a standard out of office reply for emails sent to us outside of business hours. We use site5 which has an office auto reply function but it's date specific, and has no recurring function (i.e. for every day, or set days of the week like weekends etc). I'd have to do it for every email account every night which is not practical. I contacted site5 support and they said it's possible via a ""cron job"" script in cpanel, but I don't even know what that means or how to go about it.
Does anyone have any ideas or ever made a script/plugin that would do this?
In case it helps, we use Thunderbird as the client but it would require us to leave a PC on 24 hours a day to work which is a waste. Also, Site5 have Roundcube, SquirrelMail and MailHorde built in as clients, so maybe there's a workaround in one of those?
There seems to be tons of threads on the web asking this but no solution so any ideas would be a real help."
456,"Question about Outlook for Mac, and how to get Windows Outlook featuresMy company used to use Outlook 2007 for PC. Pretty often we created tables with lots of rows and columns - and hyperlinks throughout; there was an easy feature for this. Recently we switched over to Macs and downloaded Outlook 2011 for Mac. We've found that we can't make tables anymore.

461,"If you can't sign into your Yahoo! email using Sign-In Helper, read thisHi /r/email! I wanted to submit this information just in case anyone else has run into this issue.

#Do **NOT** call *any* phone numbers or send any emails to numbers/addresses claiming to help you get into your account. There are actually *so many people* plagued with this issue that SEVERAL scams are ongoing offering help. They will steal whatever they can get their hands on.

There is no way to contact customer service for this issue - it's possible they don't even have a department for customer service for accounts, only a PR department.

Yahoo has four avenues that are designed to appear to be customer support for this issue but are not:

* The [Yahoo Help page](https://help.yahoo.com/kb/account/recover-reset-yahoo-password-sln27051.html?impressions=true) simply tells you to return to Sign-In Helper (which is where you were unable to sign in beforehand) and the [""contact"" page](https://io.help.yahoo.com/contact/index?page=contact&amp;locale=en_US&amp;y=PROD_ACCT#), once again, tells you to go to Sign-In Helper or directs you to the Yahoo Community, explained below.
* Their [Tumblr page](https://yahoohelpcommunity.tumblr.com/) has been essentially inactive since February of 2016, and a reply to someone with a similar issue from that time directs them to the [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/YahooCustomerCare), which has been literally stripped of all posts and is completely inactive and Twitter (see below). Trying to send an Ask? Their ask page [explicitly states](https://yahoohelpcommunity.tumblr.com/askyahoo) that they will **not** help anyone with any password issues through social media.
* Their [Twitter page](https://twitter.com/YahooCare) is by far their most active page. Don't get your hopes up with this one: a pinned tweet from the beginning of 2016, where they reply to and attempt to work with someone tweeting at them with an issue signing in, is right before they cut off all communication with any individuals struggling with sign-in issues. She never received assistance in the end and is still unable to log in. If you see **any** of their multiple tweets per-day, each one has a handful of people replying, begging them for assistance with being locked from their account. None of them get replies. DMing them gets the same results, as multiple people have posted screenshots of one-sided convos. It's highly likely PR team has been instructed not to acknowledge or respond to these.

The last place all of these avenues point to is the [Yahoo Community](https://forums.yahoo.net/t5/Password-and-sign-in/bd-p/PasswordSign-in), a forum made when Yahoo's PR dept. was likely instructed not to respond to anyone on social media around the beginning of 2016.

It's pretty obvious from the [main page](https://forums.yahoo.net/) that the two most active sub-forums are - you guessed it - ""Account and sign-in"" followed closely by ""Mail"". In the former, nearly 20,000 (at the time of this post) individuals have posted asking for any assistance logging in. However, even that is misleading, as many previous posts have been moved into a single thread.  There appears to only be one individual who is employed by Yahoo that monitors the forum (or at least any moderators share the one account), EchoSanders. In this single thread, her post is simply copied and pasted several times. She does not ever appear to respond to inquiry related to logging in. [This is what it says:](https://forums.yahoo.net/t5/Password-and-sign-in/Forgot-password-recovery-information-outdate-wrong/td-p/559)

&gt;Hi everyone,
&gt;
&gt;So why was your post moved here?  You were sent to this community because you cannot recover &gt;your account using password/sign-in helper, and when that doesn't work you do not have an email &gt;option alternative. At this time we do not have a fix for you as your account must be verified &gt;using an automated system.
&gt;
&gt;Why can't you just fix my account? We cannot guarantee the safety of your account or its &gt;information if we were to attempt verification via an open community.
&gt;
&gt;This is a place where gather your concerns and feedback. We hope this leads to more assistance &gt;for people in your situation in the future. Unfortunately we can't make any guarantees. By having &gt;all in one place, we can more easily track the cause and impact to those who haven't been &gt;successful using the automated system.
&gt;
&gt;We're genuinely sorry that we are not able to provide further assistance!

That statement is the only thing we have from Yahoo. I don't blame EchoSanders at all - it's Yahoo as a company that has failed to give her the means to actually help people. It's possible she could even get in trouble for trying to assist people one-on-one.

If I ever hear anything else, rest assured that I will let you know. However, **here are some last-ditch efforts you can attempt:**

* Try to use Sign-In Helper on a device you have been logged into/log into frequently. One statement on the help page states that Sign-In Helper *may* provide more recovery options, like security questions. If anyone can prove this is true please let me know.
* Keep trying passwords that fit the formula. I discovered that you are able to enter ~20-30 attempts before you are locked out for 12 hours at a time. If you forgot your password due to being forced to change it because of the [massive breach of data](https://www.wired.com/2016/12/yahoo-hack-billion-users/), some useful info is that new passwords have to be at least *9 characters long, and there is no requirement for any amount of numbers or symbols.* This may help you eliminate some attempts.
* Get an account with a different provider. This is hard to recommend because I know a lot of people desperate enough to get into their accounts need information in their email - it's so disheartening to read the posts on Yahoo Community.

Good luck to you, I'm sorry this has happened, and I'm sure there's a reason that they do this, but I wish you luck.

**TL;DR: If Sign-In Helper didn't work, you're kinda screwed. It seems like Yahoo will absolutely not assist individuals with this. Try signing in from a device you signed in before, keep trying passwords over 9 characters (no symbols/numbers required but they are accepted), and if you ever get in, change your main email.**"

467,"I just received an email that was sent more than two years ago.I just I received a email that looks like it was sent over two years ago by a friend. 

The email was a Windows ""Remote Assistance"" invitation with a date of Sun, 30 Mar 2014. I regularly provide technical support to this friend and in the past have used Windows Remote Assistance to help them via the Internet instead of driving over, so it had a possibility of being legitimate. Smelling a weird phishing attempt, though, I did not click on the attachment.

I contacted my friend (who is at work), and they haven't done anything with their personal email account today.

Looking at the headers, I see that the first hop shows that the email was received from a server called ""SamsungSeries7"" with an IP address I cannot ping (it starts with 174.0.x.x). My friend does _not_ have a Samsung phone.

How can I tell if the email was spoofed or if his account has been hacked?

474,"Alternatives to Outlook 2016 that make searching for email easy like Gmail?Hi everyone,

We've always used Google Apps for business.  I love it as I can find email literally in 3 seconds, even from 2009 just by typing a few words I know are in it.  My business partner wanted us to switch to Office 365 a year ago but I'm having so much trouble with Outlook.  For awhile I had all mail forwarding to Gmail so I could use it instead but find that clunky.  

An example is if I go on Gmail and want to find an email about a COR (internal term) I simply type COR which immediately gives a drop down which 9/10 shows the result I want right there, otherwise if I press enter it filters to maybe 40 emails over the past year all with that term.  I can find it easily.  In Outlook however, if I type COR into the search box and press enter, it literally finds every single email.  Like 20 from every day, most nothing to do with the phrase COR.  I will set it to ""Current Mailbox"" and it will show results from sent, archive etc.  I'm constantly giving up on mail I want to find because I just can't find it.

Are there any alternatives to Outlook that work well with Exchange but that are made more for searching and finding email quickly?  I've tried Outlook advanced search but it doesn't work properly, too clunky.  I'm not looking for feedback on how to properly search in Outlook as I've been given that many times before and don't find it compares at all to Gmail, but looking more to see if there's Windows email clients that might be a bit better to use.  Thanks!"
475,"[OPEN QUESTION]Should I pay for an IP warmup?My company uses a 3rd part to send e-mails (SendGrid). However, for legal reasons, we are forced to switch to a new company in Europe. 
We send around 100'000 e-mails per month to 500 different domains, in a 10 day span. This new company have offered us a person to assist us in setting up our account correctly and warming up our IP. The person will be available for 30 days (however, we will probably just use him for 10), and he/she will cost 2500 euro. 
I am a little unsure about how much this person will actually help.
If I had done this alone, I would probably try send to 1 domain at a time. A few e-mails at first, and then check the delivery status. If not bounce, I will push through the rest for this domain, and move to next. I will probably also not do all 100'000 the first month, but maybe 33% first, 66% next and 100% the third month.

Well lets now say I wan't to get 100 quotes and I send 100 companies the same email, will i get away with this or will I have to change each email slightly and by how much? or is this all un do-able??

This was for over a month ago and I still see spammers trying to send spam to this domain. Hence, I'm wondering, why would a spammer trying to spam gullible@domain.tld hardcode the mail server they try to deliver the mail to? Why not look up the current MX-record when sending the spam?"

But recently I've been getting various scam and phishing emails (all are usually images advertising credit cards or product testing) The problem is I only view email on my iPod so when I move them to junk on the default mail app, are they actually getting read as junk. I don't see how they are getting through, they usually all start with the same title "" [email] get credit card here"". I've heard a few people saying the phone/iPod app doesn't filter mail but I don't get why. There's no way to point out to the app that these are scams! They all ofcourse come from different emails and bogus senders.

522,"OPEN QUESTION: Recover ALL deleted emails in an Outlook web account****TL;DR - help me recover my GF's emails from dead relatives by undeleting ALL emails in an outlook web app account - deleted items are 9,000+ (that's no joke) ***

My GF has somehow managed to delete ALL 9,000+ emails in her inbox... No idea how she managed this and she says she can't remember! WTF ???

Anyway she wants me to recover them because in addition to *mountains* of spam she has sentimental value emails from passed family and such in there. The problem is that the ""recover deleted emails"" option only seems to allow you to recover individual emails, and needless to say I'm not prepared to manually recover ten years worth of emails.

If I try the 'select all' check box, the options to move messages to another folder disappears in the web app version.

I logged into the account through Outlook 2013 on desktop, and this was just as bad. It won't let me move more than a few emails at once and the server takes so long to update that I can't even block-move emails manually because the client starts to get out of synch after a few moves.

I also tried copying the deleted emails folder to a new sub-folder but again it won't allow me to do that because the database file size is larger than the server will allow.

If anyone can suggest something else I'd be willing to try it. Please help!"

We're using a hosted spam filtering service. The above hosts are owned and maintained by this spam filtering service. I called the tech support number for this spam filtering service today and spoke with a technician who informed me that hostB.example.com is actually a honey pot for spam. So here's my question to you guys: Isn't this bad design??? The reason I ask is because if hostA.example.com is unavailable for whatever reason then the SMTP client should work it's way up and attempt to deliver through hostB.example.com right? And if it does that then it would hit the honey pot wouldn't it? Then the client IP address would end up on the spam filtering service's internal blacklist right? This just seems like odd design.

528,"[OPEN QUESTION] DKIM authenticityI have been reading various articles about DKIM signing messages and something doesn't add up to me.

Part of a requirement to combat spoofing is that only an authorized source would be able to sign an email, but this does not appear to be the case. Consider the following email headers:

    From: Fake Sender &lt;fake.sender@acme.org&gt;
    To: Sucker &lt;recipent@anotherdomain.com&gt;
    dkim-signature: v=1; a=rsa-sha256; c=relaxed/relaxed;
    d=example.com; s=fake-key;
    h=From:Subject;
    bh=&lt;header hash&gt;;
    b=&lt;hash&gt;

I have seen email that pass DKIM verification when the hashes above are correct, but there is nothing here that forces a policy check against the acme.org domain. The only verification is computed against the public key located at fake-key._domainkey.example.com, rather than against the sender domain (acme.org).

As far as I can tell, the provides a guarantee that there were no modifications since that particular signature was placed on the message but there are no guarantees that the signature was placed by the sender email account.

    v=DMARC1; p=none; sp=none; pct=100; rua=mailto:postmaster@example.com; aspf=s; adkim=s; fo=1; ruf=mailto:postmaster@example.com

We recently added the `ruf` tag and haven't gotten any forensic reports. But we've had `rua` for a while and have a lot of aggregate reports. FYI we never have mail sent from any sender that uses subdomains; always the root of our organizational domain.

I've loaded some into Dmarcian and I'm having trouble figuring out what it's saying.

FYI everything here is from the ""DMARC Capable"" tab on Dmarcian:

[Exhibit 1.](https://i.imgur.com/eJ9yye2.png) This is sorted by DKIM ""raw"" failures. Since Google is fully set up with DKIM, what's going on here? Are they forgetting to sign some of their messages?

[Exhibit 2.](https://i.imgur.com/MmQXCy8.png) This is sorted by SPF domain where the DMARC is unaligned. I'm not sure exactly what's going on here. We're a Google Apps domain and use gCal for stuff.

[Exhibit 3.](https://i.imgur.com/wkNxErN.png) This is the ""SPF-Identified Senders"" tab, sorted by DKIM raw failures. A bunch of different domains there, both on the SPF and DKIM side. Only the blurred ones are my domain. Again, no idea what's up here.

Any ideas? This is separate from the ""Threats"" tab which are probably real examples of people forging our mail... the whole reason we're doing this is because our employees are getting messages from our ""CEO"" saying they need to transfer money into accounts, etc."

541,"Postfix: How to set BCC for incoming mails from foreign domains?Hi guys,

I recently set up an email server. I want to configure that a copy of every incoming email from foreign domains (i.e. someguy@gmail.com) will be sent to a local mail address (i.e. specialaddress@mycompany.com). 

Internal mails (i.e. from employee-a@mycompany.com to employee-b@mycompany.com) should not be sent to specialaddress@mycompany.com.

Does anyone know how I can configure that? I use fetchmail to receive mails from the ISP mail server via pop3 and deliver it to Postfix. Postfix looks up users in the active directory.

I have tried the following: 

1. Postfix - always_bcc : Doesn't work, it forwards internal and outgoing mail

2. Postfix recipient_bcc_maps : No outgoing mail, but internal mail is still forwarded.

Is there anyway to tell Postfix to set BCC when the sender address does NOT match my domain?"

Is there currently any usable/safe way to redirect email from an outlook system to gmail?

546,"Need to Vent About Yahoo MailSo I've had my Yahoo! Mail account for more than 15 years. At first, I liked it. There were occasional issues with emails taking a little too long to reach my inbox, but overall, I was pleased. But in the last few years, I've found myself getting more and more frustrated with my Yahoo! Mail experience. So if you all don't mind, I need to get everything off my chest for a bit. 

Here is what drives me crazy:  

* They introduced this abhorrent feature called Dynamic Date Dividers. It uses ""headings,"" or entire blank lines to categorize your inbox by date. They're cluttery, take up too much space (not good on smaller monitors), and are useless. Everyone hates them. But they don't give us the option to turn them off. You can temporarily disable them via the 'Sort' function, but they're back again as soon as you log in. AdBlock Plus can't disable them, either.  
* My password no longer works on Yahoo! Mail on my phone, but it works just fine on my desktop. There have been numerous complaints about this, and Yahoo just tells people to change your password . . . but it's not a password issue.  
* Yahoo customer service is almost non-existent. They no longer have a customer service phone number, and they barely even try anymore when you email them. They provide you with one half-assed solution that clearly doesn't work, and then you're on your own. They also refuse to address the above issues, despite numerous complaints.
* The amount of Spam I receive is the worst. I recently figured out that if you disable 'Conversations' in your settings, you can then sort the Spam folder by Sender. Then you can delete all ""Replica Rolex Watches!"" emails at one time, all ""Penile Enlargement!"" emails at one time, and so on. Not sure why I can't sort them regardless, but whatever. The amount of Spam I receive is obscene. And no, I did not give my email address out to any website or retail store. I have all the basic precautions in place, and I have adjusted my filters as much as I can. But I'm still drowning in spam. 

I would delete my Yahoo! Mail account if it wasn't for the . . . seniority? I've had it for so long (more than 15 years) that getting everyone switched over would be a lengthy, monstrous headache.

I know there are bigger problems in the world, but I just needed to vent. Yahoo! Mail has severely declined, and it's driving me crazy."

558,"[Service Provider] Valid.Ly - Never send another OOPS messageHello! We are pleased to announce the release of [Validly](https://www.valid.ly): a new resource management service that automatically scans and reports on the status of URLs in your marketing emails - before and after your campaigns go live. Validly ensures that your links are taking recipients to the right place and notifies you if any of those links break even after you've hit _send_, so you can fix the problem before it impacts your audience. 

Check it out here: [https://www.valid.ly](https://www.valid.ly). If you have any thoughts on how we can improve our service, please let us know!

If you're wondering why we created this service, here's a brief history: 

Like everyone else in the universe, I've been receiving marketing emails for years - and many times, these emails contain links that don't serve the sender's purpose. Whether the link is wrong (pointing to a destination that is clearly not the intended one), or broken (the dreaded ""page cannot be found"" message!), the end result is the same: a bad experience for users, reduced campaign performance, and damage to the brand that sent the email in the first place. 

There are a multitude of email marketing tools in existence, from services like MailChimp and Constant Contact to full-scale marketing automation platforms like Marketo, Eloqua, and Pardot, and after talking it over with some friends, we decided to build an independent service that enables marketers to make sure their emails contain valid references to external resources, no matter what tool they're using to do the sending. 

And so Validly was born! Here's what it can do for you:

**QA Email Content Prior to Sending**

Before you send out an email, you can visit the [Validly website](https://www.valid.ly) and paste the HTML content of the message into our web interface. Once you name your campaign and click ""validate,"" Validly will extract all the links and check them, then create a report that displays the content of your message as it will appear to the recipient. Furthermore, it also creates image previews of each page that you are linking to in the email. This is handy if the page disappears in the future, or is defaced by bad actors, or simply changes in some way (so you have proof of what the page looked like at the time of sending). When you click on a link in the report, you'll be able to see a snapshot of the page, if it's available - and the snapshots are stored along with the report in your Validly account. 

**Monitor Link Status Post-Send**

Lots of people don't open emails right away, especially if they're having a busy day, or on vacation, etc. Even if all the links in your email are working when you send it today, something could change and one of them might not work tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow. We want to make sure that you're the first person to know if and when the status of a link changes, so you can fix the problem before someone opens your message. 

Validly lets you schedule daily validations of your campaigns, and will notify you immediately if something went wrong with any of your links. Think of it as an insurance policy :) 

**Streamline the Validation Process**

You probably won't want to manually copy and paste the content of every email you send into Validly before you launch a campaign. We've made it dead easy to push content to your Validly account directly from your email marketing tool of choice: once you create an account, we will generate a custom email address that you can add to your test send list, or to your list of recipients. When your message goes out into the world, we'll automatically receive the content, create a report, and begin daily validations. 

We hope that we've create an easy-to-use tool that will provide value for email marketers everywhere. If you need help or have feedback, we'd love to hear from you!

Thanks!"

I'm looking for ways to *drastically* cut down on emails I receive. I want to receive *only* personal emails. Ideally, I do *not* want to change my address.

Creating a new email account is usually only a temporary solution. Sooner or later spam and corporate emails will sneak in. I don't want to keep running and creating new accounts every few years.

What creative strategies do people use? I've heard things like autoresponding with a custom/unique link and if the sender clicks on the link, it will go through the filter. Close friends will be on a whitelist. 

Another is to make their email address a catch-all for their domain (assuming they own it), and giving each individual people a unique address to contact you on. If you receive an email sent to an address other than this (rather large) whitelist, you never see the email. This also allows you to conveniently temporarily use an email address for a few days/weeks and then you can ""cancel"" that address.

Now, what I don't understand is how the confirmation process works i.e. how the email provider verifies that I really own the domain. And this seemed weird to me - Gmail only needs that the owner of the website puts some unique HTML code on their website as a confirmation. What surprised me is that there was no third-party involved. Nobody contacted for example the company who registered the domain or anyone else. It seems to me that Gmail just scanned the webpage, saw the pasted HTML code and basically said ""ok, you're good to go"".

This sentence, directed towards those who file a copyright infringement thingamajing, seems to hint they don't care if it's hosted on another website: ""If you’re not sure whether material *on one of our Websites* infringes your copyright, then you should speak with a lawyer before notifying us."""
593,"How to Build an Email Suppression List for Hotmail Email AddressesHello all,

My company sends out bulk emails for non-spam reasons. We do try to do a good job of removing bad email addresses from our lists but when it comes to Hotmail it's hard to tell if the recipient email address is bad because Hotmail gives us a ""550 Requested action not taken: mailbox unavailable"" response instead of telling us if the email address is no longer valid. The ""550 Requested action not taken: mailbox unavailable"" response could mean a variety of things including temporary conditions that might be resolved later. How do I determine which ones are actually bad email addresses (so I can block them) before they turn into spam traps?"

I've just finished a site for a friend and have included a contact form at his request.

Visitors are entering their name, email address and message in this and I have the contact form sending the message out as an email to a generic account my friend users for his enquiries.

I would like someone to link me to any RFC or best-practice doc regarding the 'correct' way to send these emails.

Presently I have done the following:

1. Email is sent **to** my friends inbox email address.
2. Email has a **'reply-to'** set to the visitor's email address.
3. Email is **not** sent **from** the visitor email address as I don't want to spoof it. Instead I have the email coming from a 'translation' of sorts of their address.

e.g. for a user john.smith@outlook.com, the email is sent from *john.smith=outlook.com@myfriendsdomain.com* (so I've replaced their '@' with '=' and then used that whole address as the sending account user on my friends domain, if that makes sense).

I've gone with this (3) so that the email sender is still unique to each visitor and could be searched on if need be, rather than just sending from a generic account such as *'webenquiries@myfriendsdomain.com'* or something.

Does this look about right? I can't see I'm breaking any rules or causing DMARC failures etc. as I've been careful to avoid spoofing the visitor's email address. I'd love to know if there is a best practice out there though, I can't find anything.

If anyone has any suggestions (should I be adding any specific headers as well, for example) or resources I'd be very grateful."

We also have forms on our 3rd party hosted website(different company domain) that send email on our behalf with our domain as the sender. 

We had someone spoofing us and so I set up SPF and DMARC and it seemed to help. Now we have AOL and Yahoo rejecting email because we do not use both SPF and DKIM, only SPF. This seems odd to me.

My question is how would DKIM work with these multiple services sending email on our behalf? Google shows me how to generate the key and the TXT record, but do I need a new one for each service, or does each service use the key Google gives me? I need email from all 3 services to pass when sending to AOL, Yahoo and anyone else that may reject them in the future.

I'm looking for a tool / plugin / client for Mac that'll help me tag emails when they're read I.E prompt me to do something with it - generally it'll be tagged by project (or put into a folder) or put somewhere for more action.

Also if something could be used to clear up the 5000 I have lazily not tagged, intelligently using email addresses etc that'd be awesome.

698,"[OPEN QUESTION] Setting up email domain aliasHello

In the past I have set up my own website, bought a web domain for that, and a corresponding email address. I've never set up an email account with the domain, I've always just made it the kind where if you email it then it will automatically forward to another email address that you specify. When I did this I would make it work in GMAIL so I could send 'from' my email domain. Essentially, I could handle my personal and business email in the same GMAIL inbox, being able to select which email address I want to write from.

I've just set up a WIX website for someone, I bought the domain through them and I'm about to purchase the mailbox through them. WIX says I can set up an email forwarder after I've purchased the email domain.

712,"SPF+DKIM not checking out in DMARC for Convio/Blackbaud - our on-premise exchange is fineWe recently had to up our game due to some email spoofing going on with our domain. 
We have implemented a SPF policy and DKIM for emails originating from our office and from our CRM SaaS (bulk emailer).

I have DMARC reports coming in from Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, etc. In every one of these reports they indicate that emails that originate from our office check out with SPF and DKIM. Emails coming from our bulk emailer fail SPF and DKIM across the board; every email, every mail server we send to. The messages get delivered as we have no rejection set on our DMARC policy.

I use our IP in our SPF record for emails from our office, but Convio lists their SPF entry as needing only to be outboundmail.convio.net. It looks like these IPs sit behind that DNS:
66.45.103.0/25
69.48.252.128/25
209.163.168.192/26
64.244.120.32/27
64.244.122.192/27
64.244.127.128/27
64.244.127.160/27

I have DMARC reports showing that in fact emails have been sent on our behalf from 66.45.103.72. That is definitely in the 66.45.103.0/25 range. But they still fail.
    
      source_ip - 66.45.103.72

mta-poolnonydk.cluster2.convio.net
       dkim result - pass
      spfd
      domain - bounce.convio.net
       result - pass
      
If our SPF record indicates that outboundmail.convio.net is a legitimate sender for us and the sending IP is found behind outboundmail.convio.net, why would it fail SPF? What are the passes in there? I have to use the dmarcian site or just look at raw xml.

We had them signing the DKIM with a different key than we use on our Exchange server and used the key1, key2 in the DNS entry, but we have even since asked that they use the Key1 that we KNOW works perfectly with out Exchange server. Still fails.

Any help or insight is much appreciated.

Update: We have DKIM working so DMARC passes on that. Still not SPF aligned even though everything checks out in the configs and reports. So no resolution, but DKIM allowed us to get delivery with DMARC passing.

720,"pphosted accepts email but it never arrivesWe have a couple smtp servers that after some minor struggles work great. We aren't on any blacklists, our SPF and DKIM is in order, and most email is received without a problem. However, proofpoint blocks all our email. According to our postfix logs, all the email that fails to arrive at our clients enters a pphosted.com domain, and then never arrives. 

According to our postfix logs our emails are accepted, but never arrive. It never ends up in our clients quarantine. It just disapears. I've reached out to their support team, and they've informed us there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with our emails.

My question to proofpoint users, do you frequently have to white list email server's IP addresses? If this is common practice, I won't worry about it and will continue to tell our clients to do so. However, we never need to do this with other email servers leading me to believe something is wrong.

The following is an example of what's showing up in our syslog. Redacted info in {}.

The email is lastname@washoeschools.net

I've been using my Yahoo email account for years, but I want to switch over.  The new email is more professional and I'd like to use the district email address for everything.  However, not only do I not want to use Outlook interface, but my Yahoo account is still connected to everything in my life.

Is there a way to make it so all the emails I send from my Yahoo account look like they're coming from the district email?  Similarly, when someone sends an email to my new district account, I want it to show up in my Yahoo inbox.

I basically just want every email I send, either as a new email or a reply, from my Yahoo account to look to the recipient as though it's been sent from the washoeschools.net adress.  And I want every email I receive, be it from the new district address or the old Yahoo address, to be sent to my Yahoo so I can continue to use the interface I'm most comfortable with.

I also do most of my emailing with my phone and I prefer to use the iOS built in mail app.  I really need it all working on the phone as well.  Having it all work on  iOS is probably the most pertinent of my issues as most of my email is done on iPhone or iPad.

728,"Best SMTP Service Small Business?Hi all, I was hoping that you could provide some help.

I'm a small business owner who runs a ton of business to business email campaigns, usually followed up with lots of phone calls.  My emails are typically an offering sheet with a link to my website for pictures and documentation.  Sometimes I provide my customers with documentation in the form of PDF files or pictures attached to the email.

I can send up to 5,000 emails per day this way, and anyone who doesn't want to receive these emails will be taken off the list pretty quickly.  However, I have targeted my efforts pretty well industry-wide, so most people actually look forward to them.

Recently, I haven't heard responses from people with Comcast and AOL emails, and have been called with questions about where my offerings have been.  I found out, after some digging, that I've been marked as spam by a large spam filter.  

My SMTP service did not notify me of this, and I would like my efforts in managing my emails to be matched by my outgoing email service.

Needs: Outlook compatibility; tons of feedback about who is getting my emails, who isn't, and who doesn't want them; and reasonable pricing

731,"Problem email certain RoadRunner users?Hi everyone, I'm hoping for some guidance on an issue I'm having with my work email. I'll start with a **TL;DR: for the past two weeks, I've been able to send emails from my @mac.com iCloud account to anyone except people with @tampabay.rr.com  addresses.**

Overview: I use an iCloud account (@mac.com) for all my work email. For the past two weeks, I've been unable to send emails to any of my clients who use RoadRunner email (which locally is @tampabay.rr.com). All my other emails destined for non-RR users have been sent and received without issue.

The emails act like they send okay and appear in the sent folder, but within about 6-8 hours, I'll receive a notice from postmaster@mac.com saying that the ""Delivery has timed out and failed."" And it goes on for days at a time. There's always a whole slew of smtp;452 errors attached to the message as well. [Here's what one of the recent ones says.](http://pastebin.com/UaPctzmz)

I have no idea what started this or why, because these are all clients I have on-going relationships with. And I'm also only ever trying to send one or two messages to one or two recipients at a time.

I've tried talking to Apple, Brighthouse (my ISP), and Time Warner proper...all of which has gotten me nowhere fast. Apple assured me it was a problem on Brigthouse's end; Brighthouse told me it was because my personal email account, which is totally unrelated, didn't have enough inbox storage space (wtf offshore?!); and Time Warner never responded beyond any auto-confirmation notes after reaching out to their email-support@postmaster.rr.com address. A 43-minute phone call to TWC resulted in what was ultimately ""I have no idea but I'll let you know if someone thinks of something,"" and ""either way we'll call you back in 24-48 hours to check up on it."" (That was on Tuesday.)

Unfortunately, this issue exists across multiple platforms, including the native Mail apps on an iMac and a Mac Mini both running 10.8.5; an iPhone 4; the iCloud website opened on an HP Pavilion g6 laptop and on the aforementioned Macs; and the Mail app on an HTC M8 running 5.0.2 as well. They can all read emails fine and send them fine, just not to any @tampabay.rr.com users.

Do you guys have any idea what this problem is and what steps I can take to fix it? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

I have no email accounts setup at for that domain name at the hosting acct. I'm using Google Apps for me@mydomain.com, with Google's MX settings in place at the web account.

I'm considering making the switch because we send the vast majority of our emails to corporate email addresses and we're having a hard time getting through filters.

Also, if it is, then I'd like slightly more customised contact lists. Perhaps a contact list accessible to those highest within the company, then foremans, then carpenters, then apprentices.

Etc.

Much obliged!

774,"How sensitive are spam filters to differences between From: and the SMTP server?I have used an external SMTP server (let's call it smtp.example.com) for years. Almost all of my outgoing mail has the same domain name in the From: line, like so:

    From: tmwnn@example.com

While using the same SMTP server, I'd like to start sending mail from another address of mine that does not match the SMTP server's domain name:

    From: differentaddress@example.net

My understanding is that spam filters often look for such discrepancies between the headers and the From: line as evidence of phishing. How much of a problem would this cause me when sending ordinary, non-bulk messages I expect to be delivered without issue?

(I have in the past occasionally sent mail through smtp.example.com with different From: lines, listing other email addresses I control. As far as I know the mail has always been delivered, but given spam filters for obvious reasons don't notify the sender whether messages got through, I don't know whether that's actually true.)"

779,"How to improve mail delivery rate?Hi guys!

I am running my own postfix Mail Server. All my mails are Spam filtered (at least by Gmail and Yahoo).
I don't really know why they are filtered, because I have implemented SPF, DKIM and DMARC. According to mail Headers everything is correct. 

Why am I still Spam filtered? Is it because the Received: from hostname (localhost [127.0.0.1]) in the mail header? Or am I just IP Blacklisted? (I am not blacklisted on any public blacklist. I have already checked this)

Or is it just because my IP has a poor reputation?

I have a multiple domain setup. Domain A,B and C use mail.domainB.com as their Mail Server.

I guess I am on a blacklist by Yahoo because of 'X-YahooFilteredBulk: ""My External IP""'
But what is Gmails problem?

This is the first time that I have set up a mail server, so sorry if this is a noob question.

Thanks!


A lot of people asked me whether I follow these guidelines, so here are my answeres:

&gt; If you're sending it from a residential IP address
- No its not a residential IP


&gt; If you're sending it from an IP address with a poor reputation
- Unfortunately I cant check it with the provided Link. ""Not enough mail seen""


&gt; If you're sending mail which matches certain patterns (these are hard to describe, but software looks for things like ""Congratulations, you've won $1 billion!"", in a fuzzy-matching sort of way).
 - I am sending completely normal E-Mail content

&gt; If you send too much mail to the ISP too fast
- Only I use this server, not many mails are sent


&gt; If too many people at the ISP click the ""This is spam"" button on your emails
 - Since I am still testing I haven't sent mails to other people. So nobody does this


&gt; If you don't use SPF to identify which mail servers for your domain may send email, and which servers may not
- I have configured SPF and its valid


&gt; If you don't use DKIM to sign your messages
- I have configured DKIM and its valid


&gt; If you haven't requested permission to be a ""bulk sender"" (some offer this like AOL and hotmail)
- I am not a bulk sender, this server is for private use (and to learn how to do it)


&gt; If you IP address is on any DNS blocklists
- not on any Public blacklist that I can check

Furthermore I am on the dnswl.org whitelist.

I hope this helps!"

782,"Really weird email problem with capitalizationHi guys, I've been having a really odd problem with emailing a printing company, so I figured if anybody can help it's the reddit email sub.

I emailed this company regarding a order on Tuesday using the email address they provided on their site- all lower case like it should be (artwork@example.com)

I didn't hear anything back, I emailed again the next day. Still no response.

I then get an email from them, from the same address but with a capital first letter (Artwork@example.com), saying they haven't heard from me. I reply to that email and phone up because I'm a bit miffed at this. Turns out they only received the email I had just sent to the capitalized version.

A couple of emails back and forth with their support confirm that I can only send emails to them if I capitalize the first letter- in return I am receiving emails from them also which display the first letter capitalized for me.

To demonstrate it I sent an email to two of their different addresses, the support email which were getting my messages (Support@example.com) and also the original (artwork@example.com). They don't recieve the email sent to the lowercase address, but the really weird part is that in their inbox the lowercase email address sent from me has a capitalized first letter!

On top of this they claim to of tested their email and say that it's not case sensitive. They insist it's a problem on my end.

I'm using gmail and Thunderbird. I logged into the gmail web service to see if it was thunderbird screwing up capitalizing the email addresses, but they show up exactly the same in regular gmail.

I'd like to get to the bottom of this as either there's a problem with their email system which has already cost me a delay or there's a problem with my email that I'd like to get sorted.

826,"My customers are complaining about not receiving any email?Hey guys and girls!

I am freaking out, I have a problem of which I don't know how to solve.

first of all - explanation of my company and the use of the email server:

I have a website that sells certain product, the product is digital and is being sent immediately via PayPal IPN (PayPal IPN = after a customer pays, the IPN detects it and sends the product from our database immediately).

I have a log of all the emails sent.

The system is working with no flaws, I have the system for around 4 months with 0 problems.

In the last couple of days, I keep getting questions and complains that the email didn't arrive to my customers nor to the inobx / spam folder.

In my logs, it shows that the email was sent.

the email that the IPN is sending it is: support@my-domain.com

the email always contain some text (thank you for.... + details of the account ) + a link to review us + a picture of our logo.

I am not sure what to do and how to detect the problem, I am sending around 60 emails per day(50-60 purchases daily) which isn't high amount.

What can I do to detect the problem?

worth mentioning that the complains are from a variety of email suppliers, not only hotmail for example.

Thank you!"

835,"Average CPMs for a sponsored email campaign?Hey all,

I'm from the paid search and display world, but am investigating a sponsored email buy with a partner.  I've been quoted CPMs of $250-$300.  Obviously this is not something I can directly compare to my $1.50 display CPMs, but it seems a bit high.  Of course all things are relative and if it is a super-targeted list, it might be worth it.

That said, for a premium publisher, is that *insanely* high on average?  Or might it actually be reasonable?  Again, fully realize there are a lot of variables here, but I have zero benchmarks to compare against, so any insights would be helpful."

It has dawned on me that it would be more suitable for me to use the alias (XYZ@outlook.com) as the primary name for my account.

**My questions are:**

1. How would I go about doing this? 

2. Is it as simple as deleting the alias and changing ABC@hotmail.co.uk to XYZ@outlook.com ? 

3. Does this happen instantly, or is there a period I have to wait before it becomes available again?

4. I already have (including the above alias) about 5 aliases in total under ABC@hotmail.co.uk, does that affect anything?

5. And I think most importantly, if I do successfully make the switch, what happens to emails that are sent to ABC@hotmail.co.uk?

6. Are they automatically redirected to my new primary account name? (XYZ@outlook.com)

7. Does the name I remove (ABC@hotmail.co.uk) become available for someone else to use at all? If so, what happens to all my contacts who will inevitably send emails to that address by mistake? Will someone else receive my emails?

What would be ideal, is if I were to change the account email to XYZ@outlook.com but Microsoft would keep in mind my old email address (ABC@hotmail.co.uk), and would not let anyone else use it and would automatically forward all emails sent to ABC@hotmail.co.uk to XYZ@outlook.com.

890,"Using third party mail providers with a local postfix instance (and avoiding the spam/junk folder) from PHP.I've currently got an Ubuntu VPS with a number of domains and websites being served out of it. I have a local postfix instance setup for the routing of email from PHP applications and for the local accounts. 

A number of the domains utilise either google apps (grandfathered as free) or windows live mail providers. These domains run PHP applications that are capable of, and do send, email (forums, custom forms etc). These apps tend to utilise the local postfix instance for sending unless they include an intelligent mail library like swiftmail.

My issue is that I'd like to get things setup correctly so that I'm avoiding the junk/spam folders of email providers. I have SPF setup and have been looking at DKIM though I'm not sure how I can deploy DKIM on this sort of split architecture - that of sending from both the hotmail/gmail servers and my own.

For the most part gmail will not junk mail, though it will add a 'via my.server.url' to the email. I notice that other companies don't seem to suffer from this (i.e. Dropbox emails will be from 'info@dropbox.com' and nothing else). Hotmail however will readily put email in Junk - even if it's sent to itself! (i.e. a 'no_reply@example.com' type email.)

Okay, so basically I have a stack of Exchange oriented clients  (read: small to medium businesses) with only a primary MX record pointing at their static IP hosts. No secondaries.

So, I guess I have three requirements:

I need to be able to relay, or at least hold email over for up to three days while I keep trying to relay before sending back NDRs.

I don't want to have to set up individual email accounts for each user of each business. No double tapping pls

I would like users to be able to check their new mail on webmail while the system goes back up. This may be a big ask, and really this is where complication comes in, but part 1 and 2 are essential, and I think I can get that from a qmail style server.

907,"Few guidelines to have an empty inboxI use many email services, which includes - my office account, 3 accounts on gmail, 1 on Yahoo and 1 on apple. Handling these emails constitutes major part of my day. I get a fair amount of email each hour, and I lure in to respond as quickly as possible.

It gives me a great feeling to have a clean inbox, a feeling of peace and calm and satisfaction and I know that its with everybody. For nearly a year now, I’ve been fairly consistent about having a clean inbox.

Here are my simple steps to achieving e-mail bliss:

1) Don’t check email first thing in the morning, OR have it constantly on. I have received this advise by many but never did bothered to integrate this habit in my daily routine. Believe me, It's a great habit. This is a tip offered by many blogs, so nothing new here. Checking email first thing will get you stuck in email for awhile. Instead, do your most important thing for the day, or the thing you’ve been procrastinating on the most. Then check email. Better yet, do 2 or 3 things first. Also, if you are constantly checking email throughout the day, or it notifies you as soon as an email comes in, you will be constantly distracted and not able to focus on the task before you. I check once an hour, but you might have different needs.

2) When you check your email, dispose of each one, one at a time, RIGHT AWAY. Make a decision on what needs to be done on each email.

- If it is a junk or some forwarded email? Trash it immediately.

- Is it a long email that you just need to read for information? File it in a Read folder (or tag it Read and archive) or print it to read on the road (while waiting, for example).

- If the email requires action, make a note of the action on your to-do. Also note to check the email for info if necessary. Then archive the email. You can easily find it later when you need to do that task.

- If you can respond to it in a minute or two, do so immediately. Don’t put it off. If you wait.

- If you need to follow up on the email later, or are waiting for a response, note it on a follow up list. 

3) I have only one folder : Archive. When I respond to an email, or finish reading it if it doesn’t need response, or note it on my to-do list, I archive it. Simple as that. You could add a Read folder if you want. I usually print longer ones to read later, like during lunch or while waiting for something. 

Email bliss can be achieved by following the above simple steps."
910,"Could this email header actually be from Tim Cook?Hi,
A friend and I are investigating into an email that someone sent us, claiming to be an actual email from Tim Cook. We've omitted personal information with *****.

Could you guys confirm whether this is a fake or not?

Thanks.

911,Does anybody have a usage statistic of IMAP vs. POP?Maybe someday a company like Google published the POP/IMAP usage? Would be really interesting for me.
912,"Question about GMail 4.2.1+ for AndroidHas anyone else grappled with this issue:

Whenever we have to cut an email in a way that requires multiple columns, or table cells, in a row, the images shrink or contort so as to misalign with the rest of the email.

A table in this fashion is fine:

    &lt;table border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" width=""600"" style=""min-width: 600px;""&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=""#"" width=""x"" height=""y"" style=""display: block; border: 0; min-width: x;"" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;

but a table like this, or with more table cells.. we get distortion:

    &lt;table border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" width=""600"" style=""min-width: 600px;""&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=""#"" width=""x"" height=""y"" style=""display: block; border: 0; min-width: x;"" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=""#"" width=""x"" height=""y"" style=""display: block; border: 0; min-width: x;"" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;     
        &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;

It doesn't matter if we use min-width, width, width=""100%"", declare the widths on the table cell, or anything. 100% guaranteed to distort.  If they are in a nested table, the distortion is amplified.

It seems to me that there is some sort resizing going on and this is probably leading to rounding or something, which is why if all the images are the same size to begin with, they will all distort equally and there isn't an easily discernable problem. 

If you've encountered this problem.. did you find a solution? Google turns up very little on this topic.

Thanks!"
