I come to you looking for recommendations for a new great email site. 

I currently have a yahoo account that I created when I was 13 so its not as short and compact as I would like it to be. 

I also have my University email which I have been using for more important and professional tasks. Looking to merge the two.

My university decided to create a new provider so my email address has changed, so now I""m in the market for a new email site.  

What do you recommend for personal to professional use (job hunting, receipts, etc) I dont think I've ever struggled with storage.

Sorry this will be a bit of a long one to get the explanation across.

We use Outlook and have an outsourced IT department.

The long story is...in the company I work for we have groups for each department.

for example purchasing has 5 employees, and sales email them every time stock is booked out. However we have an issue of 2 existing groups. To cut that short, basically miscommunication and new staffing lead to two groups existing for one department. 

Some sales staff use the wrong one (OLD ONE) and therefore emails get missed and have been advised to use the 'new' one. 

The 'OLD' purchasing email group is easier to access, **TO &gt; PURCHASING**  after that, just typing 'P' brings it up.

But the majority is now used to using the 'NEW' group which is found via **To &gt; company contacts &gt; 001 Purchase**

The IT have suggested deleting the **The New one** and forcing everyone to use the old one again as its easier to access which in theory is fine. But it means once again shifting all of 300+ employees of other departments to use another group. (after only just recently pushing them onto the new one might  I add)

As a purchasing employee i'm going to suggest merging the groups so that if you use either new or old, it filters through to the correct list of employees in purchasing. Is this possible?

Its mainly to avoid the frustration caused from messing all the employees around switching groups all the time

If you create a new signature in mac mail and drag in two images side by side, save it, and use that as your signature (I have to drag the signature onto 'exchange', not sure if that matters) then write a new email to yourself, it looks fine.  If you write a new email and add an attachment, it looks fine, but when you receive it you'll note that the images have wrapped to each be on a new line.

That's the core of it... more info...

I was trying to make a custom HTML signature by creating it as HTML, then making a new one in Mail, quitting out of Mail, finding the signature, replacing it's contents with my HTML, locking the file, opening Mail again... which works but gave me the same image issue as above - fine for new message, but with attachment suddenly the whole thing looks like it gets re-written - my signature is one big HTML table but what comes through the other end when you look at the raw source is html that has been broken out into other peices.

I tried various suggestions (preferring embedded images) for images using cid references, inline data base64 right on the img src property and they all had their issues.  Embedding with the span/object tag that Mail uses seemed to be the best way to do it, until I tried an attachment.

I looked into wrapping my multipart/related part in a multipart/mixed or other multipart structures, thinking I could stop the end result from breaking it up, but it seems that Mail didn't like that, everything I tried resulted in seeing nothing for that signature in Mail.

Anyway, seems more work than it should be, I wouldn't think I need to re-invent the wheel here!

I hope this is the correct sub for this kind of question.

A few days ago I saw in a routine blacklist check that the external IP of my KVM host is blacklisted by jippg.org

This hypervisor also runs my mailserver so not really optimal. Now I have checked for hours on every VM that could somehow send mail over that IP but I didn't find anything suspicious. The statistics mails on my mailserver don't show any significant rise in mail activity, either.

The mailserver sends maybe 20-30 mails a day so no chance of accidental spam.

Now after investigating I've tried to contact removals@blacklist.jippg.org but didn't receive an answer.

Is there anything I can do? I'm not banned on any other blacklist, just jippg.org

Thanks and have a nice day.

The customer has also tried to send me an email and it has also bounced back.  My client and I are not having any trouble with sending emails.  We apparently are not receiving the customers.

I want to create a way for someone to send a message to a group of people without having access to their emails. I was thinking maybe a contact form on a website, where the message gets sent to all the people who have opted to receive these messages. 

The application is so someone could write a request for treatment that gets sent to a network of health practitioners who have opted in. I would want to be able to add practitioners to the list on an ongoing basis. 

I currently have a free site with wix, but I don't appear to have the ability to add multiple emails. Any thoughts? Is there a better way to do this?

If you press *&lt;em&gt;v&lt;/em&gt; the same window appears but this time the currently selected message will be moved into the choosen folder. That saves a lot of time because you don&amp;#39;t need to scroll in your folders list and drag&amp;#39;n&amp;#39;drop your messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also love the iOS Mail-App because if you choose &amp;quot;Move&amp;quot; for a mail it gives you to options: &lt;strong&gt;Move to &amp;quot;XYZ&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; where XYZ is the folder you moved a mail from this sender last time and &lt;strong&gt;Move to other folder&lt;/strong&gt; for choosing one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I miss the iOS-Feature on a desktop client because if i&amp;#39;m doing archiving maybe once a week i need to search 10-20 folders over and over. I just would like to press something like a button to archive the mail I&amp;#39;m currently seeing to the folder I&amp;#39;m archiving them usually (like everything from &lt;a href=""mailto:info@eat.ch""&gt;info@eat.ch&lt;/a&gt; goes into &amp;quot;Order food online&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone knows a E-Mail client or addon that provides this feature? I&amp;#39;m getting my mails via IMAP.&lt;/p&gt;

- When sent, members of this email (group) will recieve the email or a notification. 
- When replying, all members of the group should see the reply. 

Note: The users are not tech-savvy. 

That's really all of it. If you can use your existing email to do it then that's a great bonus, but a login to another website/email is fine too. 

With googlegroups I keep running into inconsistencies to where the replies are actually sent. If you use the web view the original sender doesn't get it. But if you subscribe to notifications and reply from your gmail account you can choose recepients. Problem is there are 2 ways replies won't be seen by other members: user forgets to use ""reply to all"", or uses the web view to reply. Not ideal for non tech-savvy...

The earliest version of e-mail was created in 1971, and it has practically not changed since then. Although modern e-mail systems handle their core task of communication between people perfectly well, its standards fail to take into account the security of the correspondence and the personal data of its participants.\n\nAll popular providers deliver mail to their servers via an encrypted channel but store everything on servers in an open format that can be accessed by administrators, security services (who are not always honest), algorithms that scan messages to display advertising, and hackers. The situation is the same with cloud data storage. Users upload personal photos and sensitive documents to cloud storage without proper consideration of the consequences. Traditional encryption algorithms like PGP have some disadvantages: first, they require installing additional software, second, the open keys may be compromised during exchange, and third, the package-oriented structure of PGP makes data streaming somewhat complicated.\n\nFrom our point of view, the ideal electronic correspondence system must be decentralized, self-manageable and reliable. Modern encryption algorithms are secure, and today’s devices are sufficiently advanced to use on-the-fly encryption. Deploying blockchain technology should allow us to enable secure user identification and create a distributed, autonomous and self-regulating system that will enable you to access your email anytime and anywhere.\n\nThe modern standard of e-mail communication is hopelessly out of date. It is based on the minimum set of necessary functions and tools required for delivering a text message from one person to another with files attached to the text of the message.\n\n&gt;There is no guarantee that the content of your messages won’t be distorted or replaced before reaching the recipient. The maximum size of the message with attached files is on average limited to 20–25 Mb, and remarkably, this limitation has existed for 30 years!\n\nRecently most of the popular e-mail services introduced SSL as the only tool for protecting information at the transport level. But no effort has been, and most likely will ever be, taken to protect data on the servers where it is stored because private user information has become a source of revenue for all free e-mail systems that bring them billions. The only solution is using third-party libraries and components that would serve as an intermediary layer, encrypt messages on the sender’s computer and decrypt it on the recipient’s computer. But these tools are not widespread because they require installing additional software, as well as sufficient knowledge of cryptographic protection and experience with setting up appropriate software.\n\n&gt; Currently, email providers store data on mail servers unencrypted, so any person or software can view and analyze their contents.\n\nCorporations gain huge profits by looking into our private lives and analyzing our mail to show us better-targeted ads. Fraudulent employees or state security services can use your private data to their advantage.\n\nAt any time, without knowing it, you can be exchanging emails with someone who is not who they say they are. And even if the previous letter was sent and read by the person to whom you sent it, the next one may be intercepted and read by someone else. Furthermore, the response may not even come from the same person to whom the original message was meant to be sent. The existing authentication method, DKIM, can detect forged messages from a different domain name, but not from specific address. Also, the validity of a public key used to verify the DKIM signature depends entirely on the goodwill of the owner of the sender domain.

The issue is that this week, the code decided to break and not work on the email account that I needed to send it on, resulting in the email looking like this when sent. The email account I sent this on is the school provided org. email.

Code not working: https://imgur.com/AnIzdV6

However, when I tried the same code on a different email account, it worked. I've also tried this on a personal email and a personal school related email.

I'm self employed, and the business I run depends mainly on people finding and contacting us through our website. Unfortunately sometimes I get complaints that my emails are ending up in their Spam accounts, or when they reply sometimes the subject is changed to ****SPAM**** which looks anything but professional :(

I went to add my own email to our new email marketing website, and it said it was blacklisted - I couldn't even deliver my own marketing emails to myself!

Do you have any tips as to how to get round this?

Some reasons I think it is happening:

The main one - stupidly when I was starting up (about 5 years ago) I had no idea how things work and scraped a load of emails of businesses I thought I could work with, then bulk emailed them from this current email account.

Possible others - I email from gmail, but have it set up that I can either email from my gmail account or make it seem that it is coming from my domain - which is what I normally do. I don't actually pay for any email hosting/usage I just have a few @domain.co.uk emails which are forwarded into my gmail account - Is this bad?

I own both the .co.uk and .org domains for my site - it is just the .co.uk which is being listed as spam, and in particular the info@domain.co.uk which I use all the time.

I run a bookings service for restaurants and we're often liaising between diners and restaurants via email, asking restaurants for availability.

We work on a request basis with these restaurants meaning that diners make a request and then we ask the restaurants. As you can imagine, there's a lot of emailing with the restaurants so I was curious to know if there was an solution via email where we could send in a request for Date / Party Size / Time to the restaurant and they can accept, deny or propose another time via a click of a button embedded in the email? Or the email has a link that directs to a website that has those 3 CTA buttons?

I have tried mailing the same recipient with every account and client I have: 

@gmail.com, @yahoo.com, @pathfinder.gr, @optimum.net(my ISP) and none of the emails I want to actually send make it to the recipient. I can send a very short form email about the size of a text message and it will come through to their end on my primary gmail. But the extended writeup I want to send, I cannot send. I also cannot send the attachments I want to send, one is a 3+ mb pdf, the other is a 1 mb pdf. I have tried just sending the extended writeup sans the two pdfs and that also fails. 

This is the type of error I get over and over:

Or more detailed:

This guy expects me to fax him documents back and forth or even worse snail mail them via the post instead of just giving me his private email address, as if I will email him for non business related purposes! This is his work email that is wonky and ultra-restrictive. Later today I will try to find a website that can send those documents via a webform to a fax address. And if I cannot I will actually waste my time to go to a library to print the email and PDFs I want to send(no printer at home) and also to a friend's business to manually send him a fax like a caveman... 

I told this guy he should complain to his IT department or email provider because this is unacceptable in 2017 -- practically 2018. 

Is there a service like pastebin that allows me to attach pdfs and password protect them? Or does anyone know another solution?

I work for a small company that runs events for big and small companies, we want to switch from Mailchimp to another service.

The problem we have with Mailchimp is that, every time I want to send an email on the clients behalf (i.e. steve.jones@fox.com) , the “from” address looks weird:
steve.jones=fox.com@mail82.atl31.mcdlv....

This is because the domain is verified for sending but NOT authenticated.

In order to authenticate it, the IT department of each of our clients has to authenticate by modifying the domain's DNS records. Some smaller clients are willing to do so.

As you may understand, this is NOT possible with the bigger clients, mainly because the client does not want to be bothered with that.

I have reached out to Send grid and unfortunately it works the same with them.

Sometimes you get this feeling that you want to escape from behind the desk that you feel shackled to. 

The average person receives about 126 emails per day, and only 77 are really legitimate. There is a way to process through this daily assault of emails.

*""Veni, Vidi, Vici"" is the phrase I try to keep in mind when I handle email. It means ""I came, I saw, I conquered.""*

Here is how to unlock hours of email processing. 

If you are going spend longer than two minutes processing an email, then put it in a folder to process later. When you first sit down, itemize and process your emails into as few folders as possible from most important to least important.


**For example, I created 3 folders.**

1.) Email that requires a response that lasts longer than two minutes to draft.

2.) A folder where I can store things that do not need answers but are waiting for something to happen first. Much like thinking about the concept of IFTTT (If this...then that...).

3.) A folder for archive items that are valuable and may be referenced later.


**Change your mindset and change your behavior.**

* The average person types 38-40 words per minute.
* Sentences are composed of 8-11 words for easy reading. 
* Using these numbers equates to 7-10 sentences per 2 minutes. 
* Effective communication in most emails is 7-10 sentences.

Cut out the unnecessary fatty parts of the email and get to the point. 

Take Twitters approach. They limit tweets to 140 characters.


Use 7-10 sentences and convey your thoughts in a clear, concise and to the point manner.


**Be a leader through email.**

Respect the receiver by presenting a prompt, clear, concise and easy-to-read email. Your target is to keep time to a minimum in your email program so you can work on what is important.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A challenge of our time is freeing up the time to do greater things in our lives that are purposeful and fulfilling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you get this feeling that you want to escape from behind the desk that you feel shackled to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average person receives about 126 emails per day, and only 77 are really legitimate. There is a way to process through this daily assault of emails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Veni, Vidi, Vici&amp;quot; is the phrase I try to keep in mind when I handle email. It means &amp;quot;I came, I saw, I conquered.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is how to unlock hours of email processing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are going spend longer than two minutes processing an email, then put it in a folder to process later. When you first sit down, itemize and process your emails into as few folders as possible from most important to least important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For example, I created 3 folders.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.) Email that requires a response that lasts longer than two minutes to draft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.) A folder where I can store things that do not need answers but are waiting for something to happen first. Much like thinking about the concept of IFTTT (If this...then that...).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.) A folder for archive items that are valuable and may be referenced later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change your mindset and change your behavior.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The average person types 38-40 words per minute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sentences are composed of 8-11 words for easy reading. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using these numbers equates to 7-10 sentences per 2 minutes. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effective communication in most emails is 7-10 sentences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut out the unnecessary fatty parts of the email and get to the point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take Twitters approach. They limit tweets to 140 characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use 7-10 sentences and convey your thoughts in a clear, concise and to the point manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be a leader through email.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respect the receiver by presenting a prompt, clear, concise and easy-to-read email. Your target is to keep time to a minimum in your email program so you can work on what is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;All user data is protected by the Swiss Federal Data Protection Act (DPA) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection Ordinance (DPO) which offers some of the strongest privacy protection in the world for both individuals and corporations.

I&amp;#39;ve tried to work around this by trying to attach the image to the email and then referencing it, but this doesn&amp;#39;t seem to work either.  I used this &lt;a href=""https://gist.github.com/TKerstiens/ca4cfb2400c4516f7c256c1208e2d483""&gt;template&lt;/a&gt;.  I got the boundary from a test email I sent myself, but I don&amp;#39;t even know if this is a good way to go about this either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, is there a way to create an .htm file for outlook signatures that includes the image inside the .htm file?&lt;/p&gt;

So I've wanted to purchase a domain (mainly for email) for a while now, but circumstances have changed and I now have an immediate need. I initially tried setting up another free gmail account set to forward messages, but you can only forward to one address (I need to forward to two). My family has used GoDaddy in the past, but beyond that I have no experience with email providers.

Besides GoDaddy, does anyone have an email provider they particularly like? My needs are: webmail and mobile, ability to forward all messages to 2+ addresses (or set up as a team mailbox with individual access to a shared inbox), and not much else. Cost is a factor, but not the deal killer. I do not have a domain name yet.

I am stuck in a complete dead-end, and need help from you savvy folks!

I have created an email template on photoshop which is sleek, sexy and well above the standard fare for out-bound corporate communications in my business. I have however run into a problem. While I have the ability to pop into photoshop to edit the template each time I need to send out a new newsletter, I'm afraid this is above the abilities of my coworkers.

And so, to my question:

Is there a way to create an editable version of my current template which can be saved and distributed as an email by coworkers, with current hyperlinking for social icons etc, and requires no special access to higher end formats or outside sources (Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Mailchimp) other than what I can do before I provide them with the template to use?

I'm fully prepared for either a ""No"", or a ""Git Gud"", but have been banging my head against this particular wall for some time and am ready to bin the project altogether!

(Final note: I considered uploading the PSD Email template here, but there is a little too much on there that is doxable. It contains several fields which will need to be edited each time the send out the template, and social media icon hyperlinking).

Greetings everyone,

Thank you for your past and future support of Unseen.  It’s because of your commitment to private and secure communications that we’ve kept our service running since 2011 and we hope to continue to provide this service for years to come.

A couple of things have changed on the internet; we’ve noticed it’s becoming more difficult for our users to connect to centralized services and we’ve also had a lot of abuse of our free accounts. To remedy these issues we are doing the following:

-Unseen, ehf is converting to a non-profit company (project) structure, it’s just not possible to run an honest service without severe interference from various entities. It will be a project staffed by volunteers and you are welcome to contribute or donate, too!  

-Effective immediately there will no new free accounts.  If you currently have a free account, you will have until September 15th to upgrade to premium or get some FLASH coins for your account and we will end the free accounts at that time.  We will have more information about the status of free accounts in the next week or two. If you can’t afford a premium account or if you feel that you qualify for a free premium account (you are a member of a persecuted group like Falun Gong meditators, oppose repressive regimes, journalist, etc), please contact support. We had so much abuse from the free accounts, it’s not fair for our staff or the Advania data center team in Iceland to continue to deal with this. We’re very sorry we have to do this.

-We will be developing a true p2p infrastructure, based on open source for chat and calling.  This will potentially include our vpn service.   

-We will be powering things with crypto coin technology using FLASH coins ( LINK REMOVED) and we will be receiving a donation of coins from them to support our efforts and our premium users.  

More info can be found in the survey, we hope you can take the time to complete it for us:

( LINK REMOVED ) 

To thank everyone for completing the survey, we have a special coupon code to save on a premium upgrade at the end of the survey.

Best always,
The Unseen Team

So for an account on example.org, that would be `example.org@mydomain.com` which is then forwarded to my gmail address. This way, I can easily delete aliases when spam starts to arrive and also know which service had a breach or sold my info.

However, I recently noticed a problem with mails from a specific sender: Deutsche Post, dhl.de.

Those mails just didn't show up in my Gmail account at all, not even in the Spam folder. They don't have a DKIM signature, but there are SPF and DMARC rules defined. Some troubleshooting later, it was clear that the Google server rejected the mail due to a failing DMARC check:

    550-5.7.1 Unauthenticated email from dhl.de is not accepted due to domain's
    550-5.7.1 DMARC policy. Please contact the administrator of dhl.de domain if
    550-5.7.1 this was a legitimate mail. Please visit

    550 5.7.1 DMARC initiative. q13si2966659wra.187 - gsmtp

I now spent the last two days reading about SPF, DKIM and DMARC. And a thing called SRS -
 Sender Rewriting Scheme. SRS defines the recommended way to change the envelope sender to something from my own domain, so that the SPF check succeeds.

However, when changing the envelope sender to be different than the header sender (the `From:` header you see in the mail client), that causes the DMARC ""alignment"" check to fail. Which in turn gets the mail rejected again.

So basically:

1. Forward the mail as-is: DMARC fails because SPF fails - mail is rejected.
1. Rewrite envelope sender using SRS: DMARC fails because envelope and headers are not aligned

The only working way I found for now is to rewrite the `From:`-header, too. But this means losing the real sender info so subsequent filters in the mail client are harder to implement. Also this doesn't look nice at all when the sender suddenly is `SRS0=ABCD=12=dhl.de=noreply.kundenkonto@mydomain.com` (with `ABCD` and `12` being checksum and timestamp - so constantly changing).

I have been hard coding a lot of emails for my job lately, and I was thinking of making an app that provides a GUI which allows users to create emails visually, and generates the code behind the scenes.  It would essentially be a combination of a drag-and-drop editor, for including elements in an email, and a WYSIWYG editor for making changes to those elements. 

I am sure I am not the first person to come up with this idea, so my question is this: does anyone here use an app that serves this purpose?  If so, are there features you feel are missing, or would make the experience better/easier?

&lt;p&gt;I tried taking surveys and signing up for free iPads, but that&amp;#39;s mostly gotten on some email lists for similar things.  It didn&amp;#39;t get me the really low quality spam I&amp;#39;m looking for.  Posting my email address around randomly hasn&amp;#39;t yielded much either, though I suppose that might pay off in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google groups appears to be crippled, and I don&amp;#39;t know if you can even still post to usenet from it (or if spammers are even still watching that).  &lt;a href=""https://www.spamhaus.org/consumer/removelists/""&gt;These spam opt-out scams&lt;/a&gt; all seem to be shut down.  Are there any particular mailing lists that are watched by spammers that I could post to?  &lt;/p&gt;

They're both using Outlook, configured for POP3, even though GoDaddy supports IMAP.

My problem is at 7.99/mo for the accounts I feel like it's too much money.  Curious what others may be using for a more economical email provider.  Would love IMAP access, and being able to set up forwarding addresses or aliases would be nice to have but not required.

G Suite for the two accounts would be roughly break-even, but would include way too many features they'd never touch.

Not sure if there's an O365 option that's email only.  One of them has a 365 subscription for the Office apps that they share with the other person, so not sure if already having a subscription would cause any problems, or if it'd be cheaper to add e-mail to that subscription or what.

Or maybe there's another POP3/IMAP provider that's cheaper than GoDaddy?

IMAP or Exchange/O365 is attractive to me because I feel a little dirty that they both have smartphones with no e-mail setup on them.  For one it might be a little more important than the other, and trying to setup the POP3 ""leave messages on server"" setting and explain how that all works to them is way more trouble than its worth. :)

I keep searching around the net and privacy seems to be driving a lot of the providers.  Not really THAT big of a deal; I don't want to try to explain bitcoin to them or trying to pay with bitcoin for the ultra privacy-oriented providers, etc.

I also liked that ConvertKit seemed to be built with a squeeze page generation functionality. 

But I also wanted to compare it with something else for good measure, I have heard good things about Drip but I don't know as much about it. But it seemed like people looking to do what I am going to do choose both of these providers.

We have open source encrypted email (in www), as well as Microsoft Exchange driven email in our intranet (air-gapped).

I am trying to propose a solution where we can do a one-way push of emails from WWW to our intranet. It is almost impossible for me to convince the security people (they have the authority but often lacks the expertise to do reasonable ruling - their favourite approach is to say no to everything) that we can plug these together with a one-way sync (I know there's commercial products out there).

The method we are exploring now is - having a dedicated email account in the WWW (e.g. entrypoint@companyname.com) where people can forward emails, where these emails will be retrieved at a particular workstation, run through all sort of virus and malware check, and then mass import into the intranet's email system. 

We are currently trying to sync and make sure every email account in the WWW environment has an equivalent in the intranet, e.g. Steve Jobs will have steve.jobs@mycompanyname.com; and in the intranet (since we don't have to pay for domain in the intranet), it will be steve.jobs@mycompanyname.int, for example.

I am thinking once we are done with that, if people wanted to get a file from internet into intranet, he/she will just email the attachment to him/herself (steve.jobs@mycompanyname.com), and BCC entrypoint@ourcompanyname.com). At fixed interval or time every day (during working hours, e.g. every 30 mins or 1 hour or as per required), someone will login to entrypoint@ourcompanyname.com, manually batch download all these emails with all the attributes and attachments in tack, and import them into the intranet Microsoft Exchange. So send our the emails, we can do a transformation on the attributes to change the .com to .int as well.

This is just a hypothetical approach and I am wondering if you guys have done something like this and what's your recommendation?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, working in a sensitive environment which requires a totally air-gapped intranet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have open source encrypted email (in www), as well as Microsoft Exchange driven email in our intranet (air-gapped).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am trying to propose a solution where we can do a one-way push of emails from WWW to our intranet. It is almost impossible for me to convince the security people (they have the authority but often lacks the expertise to do reasonable ruling - their favourite approach is to say no to everything) that we can plug these together with a one-way sync (I know there&amp;#39;s commercial products out there).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The method we are exploring now is - having a dedicated email account in the WWW (e.g. &lt;a href=""mailto:entrypoint@companyname.com""&gt;entrypoint@companyname.com&lt;/a&gt;) where people can forward emails, where these emails will be retrieved at a particular workstation, run through all sort of virus and malware check, and then mass import into the intranet&amp;#39;s email system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are currently trying to sync and make sure every email account in the WWW environment has an equivalent in the intranet, e.g. Steve Jobs will have &lt;a href=""mailto:steve.jobs@mycompanyname.com""&gt;steve.jobs@mycompanyname.com&lt;/a&gt;; and in the intranet (since we don&amp;#39;t have to pay for domain in the intranet), it will be &lt;a href=""mailto:steve.jobs@mycompanyname.int""&gt;steve.jobs@mycompanyname.int&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am thinking once we are done with that, if people wanted to get a file from internet into intranet, he/she will just email the attachment to him/herself (&lt;a href=""mailto:steve.jobs@mycompanyname.com""&gt;steve.jobs@mycompanyname.com&lt;/a&gt;), and BCC &lt;a href=""mailto:entrypoint@ourcompanyname.com""&gt;entrypoint@ourcompanyname.com&lt;/a&gt;). At fixed interval or time every day (during working hours, e.g. every 30 mins or 1 hour or as per required), someone will login to &lt;a href=""mailto:entrypoint@ourcompanyname.com""&gt;entrypoint@ourcompanyname.com&lt;/a&gt;, manually batch download all these emails with all the attributes and attachments in tack, and import them into the intranet Microsoft Exchange.

I'm looking to get started with Co-Reg mailing.

I have previous experience with servers - I use to run my own hosting company. I have also promoted CPA offers in the past, so I'm no stranger to the industry, just the infastructure needed for Coregistration mailing.

I have a Dedi server I can use for PowerMTA, and a seperate server for Interspire, for my target amount of emails per day it would be difficult to use a VPS.

I don't plan to warm up my own IP's, I was hoping to use a shared mailing service like Amazon (as the reputation of the IP's would be in good standing).

My questions are:

1. Does Amazon/Sendgrid allow Co-reg emails? They are opt-in and therefore canspam compliant.
2. Would I get banned from Amazon quickly for mailing co-reg data?

If anyone out there is also into this type of mailing, feel free to hit me up. I'm serious about doing this, and would be open to sharing ideas.

I work with a Managed Print Service provider. Part of the job is to provide scan to email functionality for small businesses. These types of businesses tend to not have their own email infrastructure. 

I'm trying to find an smtp service that will provide guaranteed email delivery for users sending mail through their multifunctional device.

I've been trialling Sendgrid but it has me on a shared IP Group that has many IP's listed in RbL's resulting in a high non delivery rate.

Is there anyone here aware of a service that may provide what I need?

I'd like to know how to use labels properly in Gmail (and Outlook 2016).

I don't really know what kind of labels I can create without turning my inbox into a mess of labels.

For i.e let's say I create a ""Facebook"" label for everything that's sent from Facebook. Then I realise that I can see the message comes from Facebook so it's like a bit useless to tag it Facebook.

Ok, that was a random example, actually I need a proper system to sort my emails at work.

* Should I create a label for each project ? 
* Should I sort by action? (To do, Read only, Snoozed...)
* What if someone mentions two different projects in the same email? 
* How to sort the replies to that same email? Should I apply the project label to them or another label ?

And how can I set up effective rules? I tried with keywords but then some emails would be sorted with the wrong label just because one word matched!

Anyway, I'd love a little help :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

I'm looking at setting up a new website for a charity and then getting staff a custom email.

I know there are lots of places where you can buy a web domain, I also know there are lots of them that allow you to set up emails too, however these are a monthly cost, which can't be afforded.

Also, as a registered charity (in the UK), they are entitled to free and discounted software - such as google for non-profits; which I think includes some sort of email hosting?


So if anyone could help me with the following, presuming they buy a domain:

* Is it possible for the charity to host custom emails for free, as they're a charity?
* Is there only certain domain providers which are ""compatible""?
* How hard/time consuming would setting it up be?
* What would the maintenance time be?
* Would it be easy to add/remove users/emails later on down the line?
* Would the emails be able to be integrated with Microsoft Office (and outlook) if an office package was purchased for each user?

All/any help is massively appreciated, thanks for reading!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

Also got ""kam_sex"" (enlarge your penis) that's crazy, I never spoke about penis or enlarge anything.

Anyway, my html has NO image in it and the text is only weighting 475 bytes.

I'm not sure this is the right place to ask, or if this has been asked before. But anyway:

My family had a private email server that a few members still use. This server got sold with the family buissnes with the condition that we will still be able to use our email addresses indefinitely. But since the owners of the server are apparently not interested in using this server for email, they didn't update the spam filter in forever (or maybe they even disabled it, I don't know). 

I'm getting around 100 spam mails per day now, (the other users don't have that much trouble) which is really annoying, especially because it swamps the notifications on my phone. I don't even read mails daily anymore because it's just such of a hasstle to sort through all the spam.

I thought about migrating all my accounts and such to gmail but this is way too much trouble since this address is my main contact address people use and it's listed on a few websites as my contact.

I run a service based business that deals with project managers, property managers, and individual tenants. I am looking to take over scheduling directly with the tenants, while taking the work load off of the property manager.  Normally If I need to perform work in a specific tenant, I would email the property manager a prospective date, and he would then email the tenant, and then get back to me, and this goes back and forth depending on availability. After that, the property management would need to send out notices, and instructions etc. Not too bad but what I am trying to do is take the workload off of the property manager, while still involving them. 

Service I am looking for:

I would like to email the property manager a prospective date to begin work. He would have (3) options. Agree, decline, or propose another date. 

Accept: When the date is accepted, a tenant notification/flyer that we would supply is sent to each tenant on the property managements behalf, and work can begin on said date. 

Decline: If the date is declined project manager can then be in contact as to why it was declined, and problem solve how to move forward. 

Propose new date: If the property manager would like to propose a new date, it would kick back to the project manager (me), and after i accept it based on available days , it would then notify the tenants with the flyer or instructions. 

This whole thing would be based off of connections. A building (tenants), who has a dedicated property manager, who has a vendor (me)   

I don't know if this can be done with plain old email or if an app needs to be developed, or what. But if anyone has an idea, that would be killer.

Hi, I'm trying to find a way that will allow our email accounts to have a standard out of office reply for emails sent to us outside of business hours. We use site5 which has an office auto reply function but it's date specific, and has no recurring function (i.e. for every day, or set days of the week like weekends etc). I'd have to do it for every email account every night which is not practical. I contacted site5 support and they said it's possible via a ""cron job"" script in cpanel, but I don't even know what that means or how to go about it.
Does anyone have any ideas or ever made a script/plugin that would do this?
In case it helps, we use Thunderbird as the client but it would require us to leave a PC on 24 hours a day to work which is a waste. Also, Site5 have Roundcube, SquirrelMail and MailHorde built in as clients, so maybe there's a workaround in one of those?

#Do **NOT** call *any* phone numbers or send any emails to numbers/addresses claiming to help you get into your account. There are actually *so many people* plagued with this issue that SEVERAL scams are ongoing offering help. They will steal whatever they can get their hands on.

There is no way to contact customer service for this issue - it's possible they don't even have a department for customer service for accounts, only a PR department.

Yahoo has four avenues that are designed to appear to be customer support for this issue but are not:

* The [Yahoo Help page](https://help.yahoo.com/kb/account/recover-reset-yahoo-password-sln27051.html?impressions=true) simply tells you to return to Sign-In Helper (which is where you were unable to sign in beforehand) and the [""contact"" page](https://io.help.yahoo.com/contact/index?page=contact&amp;locale=en_US&amp;y=PROD_ACCT#), once again, tells you to go to Sign-In Helper or directs you to the Yahoo Community, explained below.
* Their [Tumblr page](https://yahoohelpcommunity.tumblr.com/) has been essentially inactive since February of 2016, and a reply to someone with a similar issue from that time directs them to the [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/YahooCustomerCare), which has been literally stripped of all posts and is completely inactive and Twitter (see below). Trying to send an Ask? Their ask page [explicitly states](https://yahoohelpcommunity.tumblr.com/askyahoo) that they will **not** help anyone with any password issues through social media.
* Their [Twitter page](https://twitter.com/YahooCare) is by far their most active page. Don't get your hopes up with this one: a pinned tweet from the beginning of 2016, where they reply to and attempt to work with someone tweeting at them with an issue signing in, is right before they cut off all communication with any individuals struggling with sign-in issues. She never received assistance in the end and is still unable to log in. If you see **any** of their multiple tweets per-day, each one has a handful of people replying, begging them for assistance with being locked from their account. None of them get replies. DMing them gets the same results, as multiple people have posted screenshots of one-sided convos. It's highly likely PR team has been instructed not to acknowledge or respond to these.

The last place all of these avenues point to is the [Yahoo Community](https://forums.yahoo.net/t5/Password-and-sign-in/bd-p/PasswordSign-in), a forum made when Yahoo's PR dept. was likely instructed not to respond to anyone on social media around the beginning of 2016.

It's pretty obvious from the [main page](https://forums.yahoo.net/) that the two most active sub-forums are - you guessed it - ""Account and sign-in"" followed closely by ""Mail"". In the former, nearly 20,000 (at the time of this post) individuals have posted asking for any assistance logging in. However, even that is misleading, as many previous posts have been moved into a single thread.  There appears to only be one individual who is employed by Yahoo that monitors the forum (or at least any moderators share the one account), EchoSanders. In this single thread, her post is simply copied and pasted several times. She does not ever appear to respond to inquiry related to logging in. [This is what it says:](https://forums.yahoo.net/t5/Password-and-sign-in/Forgot-password-recovery-information-outdate-wrong/td-p/559)

&gt;Hi everyone,
&gt;
&gt;So why was your post moved here?  You were sent to this community because you cannot recover &gt;your account using password/sign-in helper, and when that doesn't work you do not have an email &gt;option alternative. At this time we do not have a fix for you as your account must be verified &gt;using an automated system.
&gt;
&gt;Why can't you just fix my account? We cannot guarantee the safety of your account or its &gt;information if we were to attempt verification via an open community.
&gt;
&gt;This is a place where gather your concerns and feedback. We hope this leads to more assistance &gt;for people in your situation in the future. Unfortunately we can't make any guarantees. By having &gt;all in one place, we can more easily track the cause and impact to those who haven't been &gt;successful using the automated system.
&gt;
&gt;We're genuinely sorry that we are not able to provide further assistance!

That statement is the only thing we have from Yahoo. I don't blame EchoSanders at all - it's Yahoo as a company that has failed to give her the means to actually help people. It's possible she could even get in trouble for trying to assist people one-on-one.

If I ever hear anything else, rest assured that I will let you know. However, **here are some last-ditch efforts you can attempt:**

* Try to use Sign-In Helper on a device you have been logged into/log into frequently. One statement on the help page states that Sign-In Helper *may* provide more recovery options, like security questions. If anyone can prove this is true please let me know.
* Keep trying passwords that fit the formula. I discovered that you are able to enter ~20-30 attempts before you are locked out for 12 hours at a time. If you forgot your password due to being forced to change it because of the [massive breach of data](https://www.wired.com/2016/12/yahoo-hack-billion-users/), some useful info is that new passwords have to be at least *9 characters long, and there is no requirement for any amount of numbers or symbols.* This may help you eliminate some attempts.
* Get an account with a different provider. This is hard to recommend because I know a lot of people desperate enough to get into their accounts need information in their email - it's so disheartening to read the posts on Yahoo Community.

Good luck to you, I'm sorry this has happened, and I'm sure there's a reason that they do this, but I wish you luck.

**TL;DR: If Sign-In Helper didn't work, you're kinda screwed. It seems like Yahoo will absolutely not assist individuals with this. Try signing in from a device you signed in before, keep trying passwords over 9 characters (no symbols/numbers required but they are accepted), and if you ever get in, change your main email.**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi &lt;a href=""/r/email""&gt;/r/email&lt;/a&gt;! I wanted to submit this information just in case anyone else has run into this issue. If anyone has any other fixes, please let me know! I&amp;#39;m not an insider when it comes to email so feel free to correct anything! Especially if you have a solution haha&lt;sup&gt;hahasadness&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Do &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; call &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; phone numbers or send any emails to numbers/addresses claiming to help you get into your account. There are actually &lt;em&gt;so many people&lt;/em&gt; plagued with this issue that SEVERAL scams are ongoing offering help. They will steal whatever they can get their hands on.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no way to contact customer service for this issue - it&amp;#39;s possible they don&amp;#39;t even have a department for customer service for accounts, only a PR department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yahoo has four avenues that are designed to appear to be customer support for this issue but are not:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=""https://help.yahoo.com/kb/account/recover-reset-yahoo-password-sln27051.html?impressions=true""&gt;Yahoo Help page&lt;/a&gt; simply tells you to return to Sign-In Helper (which is where you were unable to sign in beforehand) and the &lt;a href=""https://io.help.yahoo.com/contact/index?page=contact&amp;amp;locale=en_US&amp;amp;y=PROD_ACCT#""&gt;&amp;quot;contact&amp;quot; page&lt;/a&gt;, once again, tells you to go to Sign-In Helper or directs you to the Yahoo Community, explained below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their &lt;a href=""https://yahoohelpcommunity.tumblr.com/""&gt;Tumblr page&lt;/a&gt; has been essentially inactive since February of 2016, and a reply to someone with a similar issue from that time directs them to the &lt;a href=""https://www.facebook.com/YahooCustomerCare""&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;, which has been literally stripped of all posts and is completely inactive and Twitter (see below). Trying to send an Ask? Their ask page &lt;a href=""https://yahoohelpcommunity.tumblr.com/askyahoo""&gt;explicitly states&lt;/a&gt; that they will &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; help anyone with any password issues through social media.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their &lt;a href=""https://twitter.com/YahooCare""&gt;Twitter page&lt;/a&gt; is by far their most active page. Don&amp;#39;t get your hopes up with this one: a pinned tweet from the beginning of 2016, where they reply to and attempt to work with someone tweeting at them with an issue signing in, is right before they cut off all communication with any individuals struggling with sign-in issues. She never received assistance in the end and is still unable to log in. If you see &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; of their multiple tweets per-day, each one has a handful of people replying, begging them for assistance with being locked from their account. None of them get replies. DMing them gets the same results, as multiple people have posted screenshots of one-sided convos. It&amp;#39;s highly likely PR team has been instructed not to acknowledge or respond to these.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last place all of these avenues point to is the &lt;a href=""https://forums.yahoo.net/t5/Password-and-sign-in/bd-p/PasswordSign-in""&gt;Yahoo Community&lt;/a&gt;, a forum made when Yahoo&amp;#39;s PR dept. was likely instructed not to respond to anyone on social media around the beginning of 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s pretty obvious from the &lt;a href=""https://forums.yahoo.net/""&gt;main page&lt;/a&gt; that the two most active sub-forums are - you guessed it - &amp;quot;Account and sign-in&amp;quot; followed closely by &amp;quot;Mail&amp;quot;. In the former, nearly 20,000 (at the time of this post) individuals have posted asking for any assistance logging in. However, even that is misleading, as many previous posts have been moved into a single thread.  There appears to only be one individual who is employed by Yahoo that monitors the forum (or at least any moderators share the one account), EchoSanders. In this single thread, her post is simply copied and pasted several times. She does not ever appear to respond to inquiry related to logging in. &lt;a href=""https://forums.yahoo.net/t5/Password-and-sign-in/Forgot-password-recovery-information-outdate-wrong/td-p/559""&gt;This is what it says:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why was your post moved here?  You were sent to this community because you cannot recover &amp;gt;your account using password/sign-in helper, and when that doesn&amp;#39;t work you do not have an email &amp;gt;option alternative. At this time we do not have a fix for you as your account must be verified &amp;gt;using an automated system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why can&amp;#39;t you just fix my account? We cannot guarantee the safety of your account or its &amp;gt;information if we were to attempt verification via an open community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a place where gather your concerns and feedback. We hope this leads to more assistance &amp;gt;for people in your situation in the future. Unfortunately we can&amp;#39;t make any guarantees. By having &amp;gt;all in one place, we can more easily track the cause and impact to those who haven&amp;#39;t been &amp;gt;successful using the automated system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re genuinely sorry that we are not able to provide further assistance!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That statement is the only thing we have from Yahoo. I don&amp;#39;t blame EchoSanders at all - it&amp;#39;s Yahoo as a company that has failed to give her the means to actually help people. It&amp;#39;s possible she could even get in trouble for trying to assist people one-on-one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I ever hear anything else, rest assured that I will let you know. However, &lt;strong&gt;here are some last-ditch efforts you can attempt:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to use Sign-In Helper on a device you have been logged into/log into frequently. One statement on the help page states that Sign-In Helper &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; provide more recovery options, like security questions. If anyone can prove this is true please let me know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep trying passwords that fit the formula. I discovered that you are able to enter ~20-30 attempts before you are locked out for 12 hours at a time. If you forgot your password due to being forced to change it because of the &lt;a href=""https://www.wired.com/2016/12/yahoo-hack-billion-users/""&gt;massive breach of data&lt;/a&gt;, some useful info is that new passwords have to be at least &lt;em&gt;9 characters long, and there is no requirement for any amount of numbers or symbols.&lt;/em&gt; This may help you eliminate some attempts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get an account with a different provider. This is hard to recommend because I know a lot of people desperate enough to get into their accounts need information in their email - it&amp;#39;s so disheartening to read the posts on Yahoo Community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck to you, I&amp;#39;m sorry this has happened, and I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s a reason that they do this, but I wish you luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR: If Sign-In Helper didn&amp;#39;t work, you&amp;#39;re kinda screwed. It seems like Yahoo will absolutely not assist individuals with this. Try signing in from a device you signed in before, keep trying passwords over 9 characters (no symbols/numbers required but they are accepted), and if you ever get in, change your main email.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We've always used Google Apps for business.  I love it as I can find email literally in 3 seconds, even from 2009 just by typing a few words I know are in it.  My business partner wanted us to switch to Office 365 a year ago but I'm having so much trouble with Outlook.  For awhile I had all mail forwarding to Gmail so I could use it instead but find that clunky.  

An example is if I go on Gmail and want to find an email about a COR (internal term) I simply type COR which immediately gives a drop down which 9/10 shows the result I want right there, otherwise if I press enter it filters to maybe 40 emails over the past year all with that term.  I can find it easily.  In Outlook however, if I type COR into the search box and press enter, it literally finds every single email.  Like 20 from every day, most nothing to do with the phrase COR.  I will set it to ""Current Mailbox"" and it will show results from sent, archive etc.  I'm constantly giving up on mail I want to find because I just can't find it.

Are there any alternatives to Outlook that work well with Exchange but that are made more for searching and finding email quickly?  I've tried Outlook advanced search but it doesn't work properly, too clunky.  I'm not looking for feedback on how to properly search in Outlook as I've been given that many times before and don't find it compares at all to Gmail, but looking more to see if there's Windows email clients that might be a bit better to use.

I'm very new to email marketing so my terminology may be a little off but i will try to explain to the best of my ability. 

What I'm trying to achieve: I would like to send an email to about 100 people with the same message, now I'm aware this is called ""cold emailing"" and that doing this will result in me being put in spam boxes and a tarnish on my email address. 

My question: is that from my understanding, if i send a 1 off ""cold email"" to someone (just 1 person) this wont be considered as spam and they'll see it, for example if I'm after a quote from a company and I approach them... Well lets now say I wan't to get 100 quotes and I send 100 companies the same email, will i get away with this or will I have to change each email slightly and by how much? or is this all un do-able??

But I don't know if Mailchimp will allow me to do that and if it will keep tracks of the email campaign.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, I got around 10k email addresses that I must contact and I always thought it was like 20k or 12k available for free on mailchimp but it&amp;#39;s limited to 2k.&lt;/p&gt;

My GF has somehow managed to delete ALL 9,000+ emails in her inbox... No idea how she managed this and she says she can't remember! WTF ???

Anyway she wants me to recover them because in addition to *mountains* of spam she has sentimental value emails from passed family and such in there. The problem is that the ""recover deleted emails"" option only seems to allow you to recover individual emails, and needless to say I'm not prepared to manually recover ten years worth of emails.

If I try the 'select all' check box, the options to move messages to another folder disappears in the web app version.

I logged into the account through Outlook 2013 on desktop, and this was just as bad. It won't let me move more than a few emails at once and the server takes so long to update that I can't even block-move emails manually because the client starts to get out of synch after a few moves.

I also tried copying the deleted emails folder to a new sub-folder but again it won't allow me to do that because the database file size is larger than the server will allow.

&lt;p&gt;Internal mails (i.e. from &lt;a href=""mailto:employee-a@mycompany.com""&gt;employee-a@mycompany.com&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=""mailto:employee-b@mycompany.com""&gt;employee-b@mycompany.com&lt;/a&gt;) should not be sent to &lt;a href=""mailto:specialaddress@mycompany.com""&gt;specialaddress@mycompany.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know how I can configure that? I use fetchmail to receive mails from the ISP mail server via pop3 and deliver it to Postfix. Postfix looks up users in the active directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried the following: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Postfix - always_bcc : Doesn&amp;#39;t work, it forwards internal and outgoing mail&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Postfix recipient_bcc_maps : No outgoing mail, but internal mail is still forwarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there anyway to tell Postfix to set BCC when the sender address does NOT match my domain?&lt;/p&gt;

Mail account for more than 15 years. At first, I liked it. There were occasional issues with emails taking a little too long to reach my inbox, but overall, I was pleased. But in the last few years, I've found myself getting more and more frustrated with my Yahoo! Mail experience. So if you all don't mind, I need to get everything off my chest for a bit. 

Here is what drives me crazy:  

* They introduced this abhorrent feature called Dynamic Date Dividers. It uses ""headings,"" or entire blank lines to categorize your inbox by date. They're cluttery, take up too much space (not good on smaller monitors), and are useless. Everyone hates them. But they don't give us the option to turn them off. You can temporarily disable them via the 'Sort' function, but they're back again as soon as you log in. AdBlock Plus can't disable them, either.  
* My password no longer works on Yahoo! Mail on my phone, but it works just fine on my desktop. There have been numerous complaints about this, and Yahoo just tells people to change your password . . . but it's not a password issue.  
* Yahoo customer service is almost non-existent. They no longer have a customer service phone number, and they barely even try anymore when you email them. They provide you with one half-assed solution that clearly doesn't work, and then you're on your own. They also refuse to address the above issues, despite numerous complaints.
* The amount of Spam I receive is the worst. I recently figured out that if you disable 'Conversations' in your settings, you can then sort the Spam folder by Sender. Then you can delete all ""Replica Rolex Watches!"" emails at one time, all ""Penile Enlargement!"" emails at one time, and so on. Not sure why I can't sort them regardless, but whatever. The amount of Spam I receive is obscene. And no, I did not give my email address out to any website or retail store. I have all the basic precautions in place, and I have adjusted my filters as much as I can. But I'm still drowning in spam. 

I would delete my Yahoo! Mail account if it wasn't for the . . . seniority? I've had it for so long (more than 15 years) that getting everyone switched over would be a lengthy, monstrous headache.

I am trying to use surveys to segment my email list, but I couldn't find anything that accomplish this goal in a satisfactory way.

My objective is to send out a survey to new subscribers, and use their responses to segment them into different lists. For example: If a new subscriber answer ""Yes"" to the first question and ""No"" to the second, he/she is added to a certain list. If he/she instead answer ""No"" and ""No"", he/she will be added to another list. [Fluidsurveys used to do tha](http://fluidsurveys.com/integrations/mailchimp/) by applying rules, but this tool was acquired by surveymonkey. 

So, my question is: Are there any tools or ""hack"" that could enable me to do that? 

I'd also be interested in a tool that could possibly embed the survey in the email.

Thanks for you help!

We are pleased to announce the release of [Validly](https://www.valid.ly): a new resource management service that automatically scans and reports on the status of URLs in your marketing emails - before and after your campaigns go live. Validly ensures that your links are taking recipients to the right place and notifies you if any of those links break even after you've hit _send_, so you can fix the problem before it impacts your audience. 

Check it out here: [https://www.valid.ly](https://www.valid.ly). If you have any thoughts on how we can improve our service, please let us know!

If you're wondering why we created this service, here's a brief history: 

Like everyone else in the universe, I've been receiving marketing emails for years - and many times, these emails contain links that don't serve the sender's purpose. Whether the link is wrong (pointing to a destination that is clearly not the intended one), or broken (the dreaded ""page cannot be found"" message!), the end result is the same: a bad experience for users, reduced campaign performance, and damage to the brand that sent the email in the first place. 

There are a multitude of email marketing tools in existence, from services like MailChimp and Constant Contact to full-scale marketing automation platforms like Marketo, Eloqua, and Pardot, and after talking it over with some friends, we decided to build an independent service that enables marketers to make sure their emails contain valid references to external resources, no matter what tool they're using to do the sending. 

And so Validly was born! Here's what it can do for you:

**QA Email Content Prior to Sending**

Before you send out an email, you can visit the [Validly website](https://www.valid.ly) and paste the HTML content of the message into our web interface. Once you name your campaign and click ""validate,"" Validly will extract all the links and check them, then create a report that displays the content of your message as it will appear to the recipient. Furthermore, it also creates image previews of each page that you are linking to in the email. This is handy if the page disappears in the future, or is defaced by bad actors, or simply changes in some way (so you have proof of what the page looked like at the time of sending). When you click on a link in the report, you'll be able to see a snapshot of the page, if it's available - and the snapshots are stored along with the report in your Validly account. 

**Monitor Link Status Post-Send**

Lots of people don't open emails right away, especially if they're having a busy day, or on vacation, etc. Even if all the links in your email are working when you send it today, something could change and one of them might not work tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow. We want to make sure that you're the first person to know if and when the status of a link changes, so you can fix the problem before someone opens your message. 

Validly lets you schedule daily validations of your campaigns, and will notify you immediately if something went wrong with any of your links. Think of it as an insurance policy :) 

**Streamline the Validation Process**

You probably won't want to manually copy and paste the content of every email you send into Validly before you launch a campaign. We've made it dead easy to push content to your Validly account directly from your email marketing tool of choice: once you create an account, we will generate a custom email address that you can add to your test send list, or to your list of recipients. When your message goes out into the world, we'll automatically receive the content, create a report, and begin daily validations. 

We hope that we've create an easy-to-use tool that will provide value for email marketers everywhere. If you need help or have feedback, we'd love to hear from you!

If I used the same text in every email, but inserted a couple of personalised images into the message before then sending it one message at a time to each individual (50+ messages), would this be flagged as spam?

I have run the email content itself through spam checkers and the results come back perfectly fine, but I have found some hotmail addresses have been putting the messages into spam.

Another is to make their email address a catch-all for their domain (assuming they own it), and giving each individual people a unique address to contact you on.

i really need a bit of help please.

i have a small hotel and i want to send out like a news letter / confirmation to guest's.

i have done a flyer type design in MS publisher and i found that i could drop it into Gmail and it would display instead of sending as an attachment, however this is unstable and renders at different sizes in the email.

EDIT:: i have to edit the publisher file then save as JPEG then upload too Gmail - alot of work ??lol

i don't think mail chimp or anything like is what i need 

as i need to edit it every time with the guest's booking details and each one is different.

PLEASE if i haven't explained clearly just let me know, 

is there a better way to do this or any programs that would fit my need's

I'm not even sure if ESPs care what you send to your customers. My biggest problem is the DMCA + copyright thing. I'd rather just avoid those lovely folks (they're great guys, really), and I'm worried big guys like MailChimp might care. 

Plus, even if they don't, I'd rather avoid any risk in the future by picking a good ESP that doesn't enforce any morals or laws on its users. 

So, I want it to also track user interaction + automate with it as well, do all the stuff those big ESPs do as well.

EDIT: I just checked, and MailChimp [does in fact enforce copyright laws.](http://mailchimp.com/legal/copyright/) Don't know if that's a thing to cover them though (sometimes hosting companies do this), or if they really do enforce it.  

Secondly: I don't know if they mean to enforce the copyright laws on media within the email (as in I assume hosted by them?) and if they otherwise don't care if it's hosted by another website?

I've just finished a site for a friend and have included a contact form at his request.

Visitors are entering their name, email address and message in this and I have the contact form sending the message out as an email to a generic account my friend users for his enquiries.

I would like someone to link me to any RFC or best-practice doc regarding the 'correct' way to send these emails.

Presently I have done the following:

1. Email is sent **to** my friends inbox email address.
2. Email has a **'reply-to'** set to the visitor's email address.
3. Email is **not** sent **from** the visitor email address as I don't want to spoof it. Instead I have the email coming from a 'translation' of sorts of their address.

e.g. for a user john.smith@outlook.com, the email is sent from *john.smith=outlook.com@myfriendsdomain.com* (so I've replaced their '@' with '=' and then used that whole address as the sending account user on my friends domain, if that makes sense).

I've gone with this (3) so that the email sender is still unique to each visitor and could be searched on if need be, rather than just sending from a generic account such as *'webenquiries@myfriendsdomain.com'* or something.

Does this look about right? I can't see I'm breaking any rules or causing DMARC failures etc. as I've been careful to avoid spoofing the visitor's email address. I'd love to know if there is a best practice out there though, I can't find anything.

If anyone has any suggestions (should I be adding any specific headers as well, for example) or resources I'd be very grateful.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

The only problem is the fact that it is a US company with the hosted 'half-way point' most likely being US based. (This is only an assumption for now, I've approached the company for more information.).

Since we are a UK based financial services company, we aren't allowed to host any data outside of the EU. We would need to ensure that a hosted solution like this be within the EU for compliance reasons or that we can host it ourselves in-house.

We have implemented a SPF policy and DKIM for emails originating from our office and from our CRM SaaS (bulk emailer).

I have DMARC reports coming in from Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, etc. In every one of these reports they indicate that emails that originate from our office check out with SPF and DKIM. Emails coming from our bulk emailer fail SPF and DKIM across the board; every email, every mail server we send to. The messages get delivered as we have no rejection set on our DMARC policy.

I use our IP in our SPF record for emails from our office, but Convio lists their SPF entry as needing only to be outboundmail.convio.net. It looks like these IPs sit behind that DNS:
66.45.103.0/25
69.48.252.128/25

I have DMARC reports showing that in fact emails have been sent on our behalf from 66.45.103.72. That is definitely in the 66.45.103.0/25 range. But they still fail.

If our SPF record indicates that outboundmail.convio.net is a legitimate sender for us and the sending IP is found behind outboundmail.convio.net, why would it fail SPF? What are the passes in there? I have to use the dmarcian site or just look at raw xml.

We had them signing the DKIM with a different key than we use on our Exchange server and used the key1, key2 in the DNS entry, but we have even since asked that they use the Key1 that we KNOW works perfectly with out Exchange server. Still fails.

Any help or insight is much appreciated.

Update: We have DKIM working so DMARC passes on that. Still not SPF aligned even though everything checks out in the configs and reports. So no resolution, but DKIM allowed us to get delivery with DMARC passing.

However, not only do I not want to use Outlook interface, but my Yahoo account is still connected to everything in my life.

Is there a way to make it so all the emails I send from my Yahoo account look like they're coming from the district email?  Similarly, when someone sends an email to my new district account, I want it to show up in my Yahoo inbox.

I'll start with a **TL;DR: for the past two weeks, I've been able to send emails from my @mac.com iCloud account to anyone except people with @tampabay.rr.com  addresses.**

Overview: I use an iCloud account (@mac.com) for all my work email. For the past two weeks, I've been unable to send emails to any of my clients who use RoadRunner email (which locally is @tampabay.rr.com). All my other emails destined for non-RR users have been sent and received without issue.

The emails act like they send okay and appear in the sent folder, but within about 6-8 hours, I'll receive a notice from postmaster@mac.com saying that the ""Delivery has timed out and failed."" And it goes on for days at a time. There's always a whole slew of smtp;452 errors attached to the message as well. [Here's what one of the recent ones says.](http://pastebin.com/UaPctzmz)

I have no idea what started this or why, because these are all clients I have on-going relationships with. And I'm also only ever trying to send one or two messages to one or two recipients at a time.

I've tried talking to Apple, Brighthouse (my ISP), and Time Warner proper...all of which has gotten me nowhere fast. Apple assured me it was a problem on Brigthouse's end; Brighthouse told me it was because my personal email account, which is totally unrelated, didn't have enough inbox storage space (wtf offshore?!); and Time Warner never responded beyond any auto-confirmation notes after reaching out to their email-support@postmaster.rr.com address. A 43-minute phone call to TWC resulted in what was ultimately ""I have no idea but I'll let you know if someone thinks of something,"" and ""either way we'll call you back in 24-48 hours to check up on it.""

Unfortunately, this issue exists across multiple platforms, including the native Mail apps on an iMac and a Mac Mini both running 10.8.5; an iPhone 4; the iCloud website opened on an HP Pavilion g6 laptop and on the aforementioned Macs; and the Mail app on an HTC M8 running 5.0.2 as well.

Bob jake is a fake email account my brother created, and I have messed around with the bob jake email but I don&amp;#39;t know how I managed to change my personal email name to bob jake. If any one needs extra info, I&amp;#39;ll do the best I can to provide it, thanks guys!&lt;/p&gt;

Is it more reliable (less likely to have missing emails) to use Cpanel, and have mail forwarded to Gmail, or use Google Apps?

I have a shared web hosting acct with several domain names, including one I'll call mydomain.com, which I have one email address associated with: me@mydomain.com. I have no email accounts setup at for that domain name at the hosting acct. I'm using Google Apps for me@mydomain.com, with Google's MX settings in place at the web account. 

This generally works, but I've had a few problems with emails missing, even mid-thread. I'm thinking of losing the Google Apps configuration and setting up an email account with Cpanel, for me@mydomain.com, and having that forwarded to my Gmail account (not Google Apps).

he has 6 email accounts, but it's effected every email in one accounts inbox, all the same accounts deleted items, and then randomly effected emails in other saved folders (all other email accounts look fine, but didn't check every single email)

some of the emails are pretty important and they desperaly need them back

I forwarded one email onto my gmail account, and when I received it, it was fixed....

tried it with other emails, but apparently email servers will reject any email with more than 998 characters without a space/break... so the vast majority of the emails won't forward on

any ideas anyone ?

I downloaded 4 different programs which are supposed to fix email headers but non of them worked

- I own a website that lets members download certain digital goods and when you register for these goods it subscribes you to the mailing list as part of the service we e-mail updates for when content is available to download. 

- Members can easily unsubscribe from the e-mails by either editing it in their profile **OR** e-mailing either support@website.com **/** admin@website.com **OR** by the contact form **OR the MAIN** way by simply clicking ""Unsubscribe"" which is quite clearly marked in the e-mails, it's not in the small print like many other websites do. Doing any of these will stop them receiving our e-mails however no one ever unsubscribes because they want the update because they want to get the content ASAP.

# What I am doing:

- I am sending html emails to my subscribed and verified members via Wordpress but a few members have reported that they are going into their spam folder and looking at the trace reports a lot aren't getting through...

# Details: 

- We are not flagged on any website as spam and our host and IP are both clean.

- My server is setup with DKIM and SPF to try and prevent e-mails being marked incorrectly as spam. (Although I have no idea if this is being ""sent"" or not because I can't see it in the email source, it's just set to enabled on my cpanel/whm account, I did a SPF check on a website and entered my domain which returned saying SPF was working correctly but the sites all asked for a 3 letter code for the DKIM which I have no idea about.

# Examples:

An example copy of what my e-mails look like (everything is different but this is roughly what I am doing, these e-mails get automatically marked as spam just the same as my original e-mails:

# JS Fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/2br59nfb/

# Pastebin: http://pastebin.com/vM5B1Krq

# What I've noticed:

- Obviously with the line too long error it looks like it's down to the base64 images... I've changed that to https (SSL) links to the images but I'd prefer for my members not to have to click ""View Images"" / ""View External Images"" **(Is there a way?)**

- The base64 images in Thunderbird and many other desktop clients come through fine but on outlook (live, hotmail, msn) they just appear as blank grey boxes rather than the actual image...

# What I need help with...

- Could anyone advise on how to avoid/prevent my e-mails being marked as spam by default when they aren't spam and my members actually WANT the e-mails...

- If possible could someone help with some design tips, hints or templates that are friendly for mobile devices to receive but are more than just simple plain text e-mails that are incredibly boring and lack the pretty, professional and attractive.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Background Information:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Examples:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example copy of what my e-mails look like (everything is different but this is roughly what I am doing, these e-mails get automatically marked as spam just the same as my original e-mails:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;JS Fiddle: &lt;a href=""https://jsfiddle.net/2br59nfb/""&gt;https://jsfiddle.net/2br59nfb/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Pastebin: &lt;a href=""http://pastebin.com/vM5B1Krq""&gt;http://pastebin.com/vM5B1Krq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;What I&amp;#39;ve noticed:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously with the line too long error it looks like it&amp;#39;s down to the base64 images... I&amp;#39;ve changed that to https (SSL) links to the images but I&amp;#39;d prefer for my members not to have to click &amp;quot;View Images&amp;quot; / &amp;quot;View External Images&amp;quot; &lt;strong&gt;(Is there a way?)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The base64 images in Thunderbird and many other desktop clients come through fine but on outlook (live, hotmail, msn) they just appear as blank grey boxes rather than the actual image...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;What I need help with...&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could anyone advise on how to avoid/prevent my e-mails being marked as spam by default when they aren&amp;#39;t spam and my members actually WANT the e-mails...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If possible could someone help with some design tips, hints or templates that are friendly for mobile devices to receive but are more than just simple plain text e-mails that are incredibly boring and lack the pretty, professional and attractive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

PayPal	

We're updating our chargeback fees.


As a PayPal seller, you may have noticed that there's a cost whenever a buyer cancels a payment through a debit or credit card company. We need to adjust chargeback fees to be more in line with US fees, so we're raising it a bit for PayPal accounts starting 1 Jan, 2015.

Here's a link to see the new, full chargeback table here so you can see how this will affect you. We want to make sure our sellers aren't surprised by this change and have plenty of time to prepare. 

As always, if you need help or have any questions, please give us a call or visit our Help Center here.	

Thank you for being a PayPal customer.

I'm not sure if I'm in the right place but here goes!

I run a construction company and each of my foremen have an iphone and company email address that they use.

I want to be able to create a contacts list on Outlook in the office and be able to update it from the office and pretty much instantly be updated on their phones. (example) I find a new timber supplier to use and enter their details into the central contacts list and have that update on their devices.

Is this possible?

Also, if it is, then I'd like slightly more customised contact lists. Perhaps a contact list accessible to those highest within the company, then foremans, then carpenters, then apprentices.

Etc.

Much obliged!

I am running my own postfix Mail Server. All my mails are Spam filtered (at least by Gmail and Yahoo).
I don't really know why they are filtered, because I have implemented SPF, DKIM and DMARC. According to mail Headers everything is correct. 

Why am I still Spam filtered? Is it because the Received: from hostname (localhost [127.0.0.1]) in the mail header? Or am I just IP Blacklisted? (I am not blacklisted on any public blacklist. I have already checked this)

Or is it just because my IP has a poor reputation?

I have a multiple domain setup. Domain A,B and C use mail.domainB.com as their Mail Server.

I guess I am on a blacklist by Yahoo because of 'X-YahooFilteredBulk: ""My External IP""'
But what is Gmails problem?

This is the first time that I have set up a mail server, so sorry if this is a noob question.

Thanks!


A lot of people asked me whether I follow these guidelines, so here are my answeres:

&gt; If you're sending it from a residential IP address
- No its not a residential IP


&gt; If you're sending it from an IP address with a poor reputation
- Unfortunately I cant check it with the provided Link. ""Not enough mail seen""


&gt; If you're sending mail which matches certain patterns (these are hard to describe, but software looks for things like ""Congratulations, you've won $1 billion!"", in a fuzzy-matching sort of way).
 - I am sending completely normal E-Mail content

&gt; If you send too much mail to the ISP too fast
- Only I use this server, not many mails are sent


&gt; If too many people at the ISP click the ""This is spam"" button on your emails
 - Since I am still testing I haven't sent mails to other people. So nobody does this


&gt; If you don't use SPF to identify which mail servers for your domain may send email, and which servers may not
- I have configured SPF and its valid


&gt; If you don't use DKIM to sign your messages
- I have configured DKIM and its valid


&gt; If you haven't requested permission to be a ""bulk sender"" (some offer this like AOL and hotmail)
- I am not a bulk sender, this server is for private use (and to learn how to do it)


&gt; If you IP address is on any DNS blocklists
- not on any Public blacklist that I can check

Furthermore I am on the dnswl.org whitelist.

I hope this helps!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi guys!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am running my own postfix Mail Server. All my mails are Spam filtered (at least by Gmail and Yahoo).
I don&amp;#39;t really know why they are filtered, because I have implemented SPF, DKIM and DMARC. According to mail Headers everything is correct. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why am I still Spam filtered? Is it because the Received: from hostname (localhost [127.0.0.1]) in the mail header? Or am I just IP Blacklisted? (I am not blacklisted on any public blacklist. I have already checked this)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or is it just because my IP has a poor reputation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the Header from Gmail:&lt;/p&gt;

I emailed this company regarding a order on Tuesday using the email address they provided on their site- all lower case like it should be (artwork@example.com)

I didn't hear anything back, I emailed again the next day. Still no response.

I then get an email from them, from the same address but with a capital first letter (Artwork@example.com), saying they haven't heard from me. I reply to that email and phone up because I'm a bit miffed at this. Turns out they only received the email I had just sent to the capitalized version.

A couple of emails back and forth with their support confirm that I can only send emails to them if I capitalize the first letter- in return I am receiving emails from them also which display the first letter capitalized for me.

To demonstrate it I sent an email to two of their different addresses, the support email which were getting my messages (Support@example.com) and also the original (artwork@example.com). They don't recieve the email sent to the lowercase address, but the really weird part is that in their inbox the lowercase email address sent from me has a capitalized first letter!

On top of this they claim to of tested their email and say that it's not case sensitive. They insist it's a problem on my end.

I'm using gmail and Thunderbird. I logged into the gmail web service to see if it was thunderbird screwing up capitalizing the email addresses, but they show up exactly the same in regular gmail.

I'd like to get to the bottom of this as either there's a problem with their email system which has already cost me a delay or there's a problem with my email that I'd like to get sorted.

There's nothing of the sort in the e-mail and I'm a tad bit confused now. **I'm using gmail** btw. I can only guess that she uses something very different where something like this is possible.

The funny thing is that at first I thought that it would be an attachment because my phone app was displaying the little paperclip icon but when I switched to the desktop it was not there.

I hope you can help me.

I will obviously write to her tomorrow if things don't work out. But I wanted to check it first with you guys since I don't want to look stupid (hopefully) in my future employer's eyes.

Which free e-mail service is the best to use? Here are the requirements:

1) Easy and newbie friendly.

2) Since easy and newbie friendly, it needs to be able to detect spams and malwares so the user won't fall for them.

3) Supports Chinese languages with English.

4) No blockages like with China and others.

5) Acesssible from any e-mail clients on computers, portable devices (e.g., iOS and Android), etc.

Would Gmail service be the best option to use?

I am freaking out, I have a problem of which I don't know how to solve.

first of all - explanation of my company and the use of the email server:

I have a website that sells certain product, the product is digital and is being sent immediately via PayPal IPN (PayPal IPN = after a customer pays, the IPN detects it and sends the product from our database immediately).

I have a log of all the emails sent.

The system is working with no flaws, I have the system for around 4 months with 0 problems.

In the last couple of days, I keep getting questions and complains that the email didn't arrive to my customers nor to the inobx / spam folder.

In my logs, it shows that the email was sent.

the email that the IPN is sending it is: support@my-domain.com

the email always contain some text (thank you for.... + details of the account ) + a link to review us + a picture of our logo.

I am not sure what to do and how to detect the problem, I am sending around 60 emails per day(50-60 purchases daily) which isn't high amount.

What can I do to detect the problem?

worth mentioning that the complains are from a variety of email suppliers, not only hotmail for example.

Why can&amp;#39;t protocols for email or messaging in general handle retraction/unsending/deletion after send? It seems simple to include a way to send a command to delete an email on an SMTP server, for example. Obviously there are limitations, such as if it&amp;#39;s stored locally, and questions arise if the email has been read.

**Scenario:**

I have an email address, say ABC@hotmail.co.uk.

However, within that account, I have an alias, say XYZ@outlook.com. 

It has dawned on me that it would be more suitable for me to use the alias (XYZ@outlook.com) as the primary name for my account.

**My questions are:**

1. How would I go about doing this? 

2. Is it as simple as deleting the alias and changing ABC@hotmail.co.uk to XYZ@outlook.com ? 

3. Does this happen instantly, or is there a period I have to wait before it becomes available again?

4. I already have (including the above alias) about 5 aliases in total under ABC@hotmail.co.uk, does that affect anything?

5. And I think most importantly, if I do successfully make the switch, what happens to emails that are sent to ABC@hotmail.co.uk?

6. Are they automatically redirected to my new primary account name? (XYZ@outlook.com)

7. Does the name I remove (ABC@hotmail.co.uk) become available for someone else to use at all? If so, what happens to all my contacts who will inevitably send emails to that address by mistake? Will someone else receive my emails?

What would be ideal, is if I were to change the account email to XYZ@outlook.com but Microsoft would keep in mind my old email address (ABC@hotmail.co.uk), and would not let anyone else use it and would automatically forward all emails sent to ABC@hotmail.co.uk to XYZ@outlook.com. 

Sorry for any confusion, but I need some advice in this matter and I would be grateful for your help.

Okay, so basically I have a stack of Exchange oriented clients  (read: small to medium businesses) with only a primary MX record pointing at their static IP hosts. No secondaries.

So, I guess I have three requirements:

I need to be able to relay, or at least hold email over for up to three days while I keep trying to relay before sending back NDRs.

I don't want to have to set up individual email accounts for each user of each business. No double tapping pls

I would like users to be able to check their new mail on webmail while the system goes back up. This may be a big ask, and really this is where complication comes in, but part 1 and 2 are essential, and I think I can get that from a qmail style server.

First time poster here.
Today at work i got an idea.
Would it be useful if you could select parts of an email that just some receivers would see?

For example:
Every mail i send to some client, i have to forward to my boss too (or put him into CC or BCC). And id like too just add something to that email than only my boss can see.

Like:

* [To everyone] Change the design of that website - 500€ [/To everyone]
* [To boss] This will probably be too expensive for the client, and he wont agree [/To boss].

I hope you people get what I mean.
I could ,of course, just send two emails, but its just a thought I had and i could use some opinions.

Thanks :)

Handling these emails constitutes major part of my day. I get a fair amount of email each hour, and I lure in to respond as quickly as possible.

It gives me a great feeling to have a clean inbox, a feeling of peace and calm and satisfaction and I know that its with everybody. For nearly a year now, I’ve been fairly consistent about having a clean inbox.

Here are my simple steps to achieving e-mail bliss:

1) Don’t check email first thing in the morning, OR have it constantly on. I have received this advise by many but never did bothered to integrate this habit in my daily routine. Believe me, It's a great habit. This is a tip offered by many blogs, so nothing new here. Checking email first thing will get you stuck in email for awhile. Instead, do your most important thing for the day, or the thing you’ve been procrastinating on the most. Then check email. Better yet, do 2 or 3 things first. Also, if you are constantly checking email throughout the day, or it notifies you as soon as an email comes in, you will be constantly distracted and not able to focus on the task before you. I check once an hour, but you might have different needs.

2) When you check your email, dispose of each one, one at a time, RIGHT AWAY. Make a decision on what needs to be done on each email.

- If it is a junk or some forwarded email? Trash it immediately.

- Is it a long email that you just need to read for information? File it in a Read folder (or tag it Read and archive) or print it to read on the road (while waiting, for example).

- If the email requires action, make a note of the action on your to-do. Also note to check the email for info if necessary. Then archive the email. You can easily find it later when you need to do that task.

- If you can respond to it in a minute or two, do so immediately. Don’t put it off. If you wait.

- If you need to follow up on the email later, or are waiting for a response, note it on a follow up list. 

3) I have only one folder : Archive. When I respond to an email, or finish reading it if it doesn’t need response, or note it on my to-do list, I archive it. Simple as that. You could add a Read folder if you want. I usually print longer ones to read later, like during lunch or while waiting for something.

Whenever we have to cut an email in a way that requires multiple columns, or table cells, in a row, the images shrink or contort so as to misalign with the rest of the email.

A table in this fashion is fine:

    &lt;table border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" width=""600"" style=""min-width: 600px;""&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=""#"" width=""x"" height=""y"" style=""display: block; border: 0; min-width: x;"" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;

but a table like this, or with more table cells.. we get distortion:

    &lt;table border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" width=""600"" style=""min-width: 600px;""&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=""#"" width=""x"" height=""y"" style=""display: block; border: 0; min-width: x;"" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=""#"" width=""x"" height=""y"" style=""display: block; border: 0; min-width: x;"" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;     
        &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;

It doesn't matter if we use min-width, width, width=""100%"", declare the widths on the table cell, or anything. 100% guaranteed to distort.  If they are in a nested table, the distortion is amplified.

It seems to me that there is some sort resizing going on and this is probably leading to rounding or something, which is why if all the images are the same size to begin with, they will all distort equally and there isn't an easily discernable problem. 

If you've encountered this problem.. did you find a solution? Google turns up very little on this topic.

Sorry this will be a bit of a long one to get the explanation across.

We use Outlook and have an outsourced IT department.

The long story is...in the company I work for we have groups for each department.

for example purchasing has 5 employees, and sales email them every time stock is booked out. However we have an issue of 2 existing groups. To cut that short, basically miscommunication and new staffing lead to two groups existing for one department. 

Some sales staff use the wrong one (OLD ONE) and therefore emails get missed and have been advised to use the 'new' one. 

The 'OLD' purchasing email group is easier to access, **TO &gt; PURCHASING**  after that, just typing 'P' brings it up.

But the majority is now used to using the 'NEW' group which is found via **To &gt; company contacts &gt; 001 Purchase**

The IT have suggested deleting the **The New one** and forcing everyone to use the old one again as its easier to access which in theory is fine. But it means once again shifting all of 300+ employees of other departments to use another group. (after only just recently pushing them onto the new one might  I add)

As a purchasing employee i'm going to suggest merging the groups so that if you use either new or old, it filters through to the correct list of employees in purchasing. Is this possible?

Its mainly to avoid the frustration caused from messing all the employees around switching groups all the time

If you create a new signature in mac mail and drag in two images side by side, save it, and use that as your signature (I have to drag the signature onto 'exchange', not sure if that matters) then write a new email to yourself, it looks fine.  If you write a new email and add an attachment, it looks fine, but when you receive it you'll note that the images have wrapped to each be on a new line.

That's the core of it... more info...

I was trying to make a custom HTML signature by creating it as HTML, then making a new one in Mail, quitting out of Mail, finding the signature, replacing it's contents with my HTML, locking the file, opening Mail again... which works but gave me the same image issue as above - fine for new message, but with attachment suddenly the whole thing looks like it gets re-written - my signature is one big HTML table but what comes through the other end when you look at the raw source is html that has been broken out into other peices.

I tried various suggestions (preferring embedded images) for images using cid references, inline data base64 right on the img src property and they all had their issues.  Embedding with the span/object tag that Mail uses seemed to be the best way to do it, until I tried an attachment.

I looked into wrapping my multipart/related part in a multipart/mixed or other multipart structures, thinking I could stop the end result from breaking it up, but it seems that Mail didn't like that, everything I tried resulted in seeing nothing for that signature in Mail.

Anyway, seems more work than it should be, I wouldn't think I need to re-invent the wheel here!

I hope this is the correct sub for this kind of question.

A few days ago I saw in a routine blacklist check that the external IP of my KVM host is blacklisted by jippg.org

This hypervisor also runs my mailserver so not really optimal. Now I have checked for hours on every VM that could somehow send mail over that IP but I didn't find anything suspicious. The statistics mails on my mailserver don't show any significant rise in mail activity, either.

The mailserver sends maybe 20-30 mails a day so no chance of accidental spam.

Now after investigating I've tried to contact removals@blacklist.jippg.org but didn't receive an answer.

Is there anything I can do? I'm not banned on any other blacklist, just jippg.org

Thanks and have a nice day.
