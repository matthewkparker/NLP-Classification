71,"First Time Impression Ratio dropping quickly, but less than 2% of the audience has been reached.Basically, as the title says I've gone from 98% FTIR, down to 50% over the course of a week. At the same time, I've only reached 1.66% of the audience (Men, 65+, with dog-related interests, mobile-only placement). I've noticed a significant decrease in the performance of my ad since then.

I'm still in the testing phase of what ads do and don't work, so it's a bit of a bummer that my most promising audience is burning out. I wanted to continue filtering in on this audience, but it's dropping so quickly that it's basically becoming useless.

317,"Forwarding emails and DKIM/SPF/DMARC - what's correct?I have a domain and set up email forwards for each and every service I sign up for. So for an account on example.org, that would be `example.org@mydomain.com` which is then forwarded to my gmail address. This way, I can easily delete aliases when spam starts to arrive and also know which service had a breach or sold my info.

However, I recently noticed a problem with mails from a specific sender: Deutsche Post, dhl.de.

Those mails just didn't show up in my Gmail account at all, not even in the Spam folder. They don't have a DKIM signature, but there are SPF and DMARC rules defined. Some troubleshooting later, it was clear that the Google server rejected the mail due to a failing DMARC check:

    550-5.7.1 Unauthenticated email from dhl.de is not accepted due to domain's
    550-5.7.1 DMARC policy. Please contact the administrator of dhl.de domain if
    550-5.7.1 this was a legitimate mail. Please visit
    550-5.7.1  https://support.google.com/mail/answer/2451690 to learn about the
    550 5.7.1 DMARC initiative. q13si2966659wra.187 - gsmtp

I now spent the last two days reading about SPF, DKIM and DMARC. And a thing called SRS -
 Sender Rewriting Scheme. SRS defines the recommended way to change the envelope sender to something from my own domain, so that the SPF check succeeds.

However, when changing the envelope sender to be different than the header sender (the `From:` header you see in the mail client), that causes the DMARC ""alignment"" check to fail. Which in turn gets the mail rejected again.

So basically:

1. Forward the mail as-is: DMARC fails because SPF fails - mail is rejected.
1. Rewrite envelope sender using SRS: DMARC fails because envelope and headers are not aligned

The only working way I found for now is to rewrite the `From:`-header, too. But this means losing the real sender info so subsequent filters in the mail client are harder to implement. Also this doesn't look nice at all when the sender suddenly is `SRS0=ABCD=12=dhl.de=noreply.kundenkonto@mydomain.com` (with `ABCD` and `12` being checksum and timestamp - so constantly changing).

Is there any other/better approach? Or is this probably even a misconfiguration on dhl.de?"

I have a question regarding Email marketing and SEO.

Our goal is to have as many subscribers to our multiple and different E-mail newsletters, as possible, so we want to make it even easier to signup from our newsletter form. I was thinking about prefilling the ""e-mail"" and ""name"" section of the user and this way make it easier for them to just hit ""send"", thus growing our subscription rate.

This data is only going to be taken if the user has already signed up for other newsletter on our site (as I said we have multiple newsletters).

My questions are:

* would there be any GDPR problems regarding this, since we are going to take data that the user once provided but we are just going to show it to them when he goes to another page of our website;
* are there any SEO dangers - is the data more vulnerable this way and are we going to be attacked by email harvesters;
* are there any good practices regarding this case.

Thanks in advance to everyone who answers. I think it's an interesting case for a discussion :)

654,"Facebook Ads - which agency or freelancer?I've avoided posting this for a few weeks now, but I figured it was time to stop holding off.

I see lots of people posting on Reddit and on forums that they're seeing huge success with Facebook Ads. We have a solid ecommerce website, but FB Ads have never really taken off for us. In the past we've used a big agency, who just blew a tonne of money on them for little or no return. The problem is there are so many agencies out there, we can't possibly work through them all, wasting cash, until we find one who actually know what they're doing.

I've done research on Google, posted on forums and even posted jobs on Upwork etc. How on earth do you find a solid, reliable FB Ads agency or freelancer to work with? Someone who's not going to blow all of your budget for no return, and someone who understands the importance of us seeing a quick ROI.

We literally just need to make the acquaintance of a reliable agency with a solid track record of delivering results, who have good comms. But finding that agency seems to be quite the challenge and I'm becoming a little tired of it.

190,"Question About AnalyticsI run ads for my company, and our backend (woocommerce reports) says we get, say, 20 sales last weekend, but 3 are clearly attributed to ads. My boss wants to know what the ads are doing, so I try to explain it to him. He's a visual learner, though, so I show him the FB Ads Manager &amp; Google Analytics.  


Backend says we made $100ish from those 3 sales. Backend says we made like $500 from all 20 sales. Facebook says we made 8 sales, for $800. Google analytics says we made 1 sale for $10. I have already reinstalled Facebook pixels several times, made sure it wasn't in any header/snippet plugins. I know some company before me tried ""integrating"" the two, so putting pixel on google tag manager, and the custom conversions I have set up, I set the values to $0.

From my understanding, the inconsistency in the reporting is due to the attribution window, and how they attribute clicks. But ... $10 vs $100 vs $800. That's kind of a big difference.  


I scoured the internet, can't really find/understand a solution. Thanks in advance."
0,"Do we need BrightEdge, or just an audit?Does anyone use this?  Is it worth the cost?  I think most of our content could use an optimization from a tool like this, but unsure we'd need it on an ongoing basis.  Are there people or agencies out there that pay for a tool like this, but can provide its data at a lower cost and run it against our site and provide an audit every quarter or year?

Our basic use case for it would be to optimize titles, meta descriptions, and text on our pages to try to rank slightly better.  We have several international editions that their tool could optimize as well which would be very helpful."
80,"Reason why my facebook offer ad is not converting?I created a 95% off coupon for 2 products im currently launching. Usually i dont have any trouble at all giving away 30 products a day with a 95% off coupon. Product A is going great, however i am having trouble with Product B.

- Product A: 34 clicks ($0.21 CPC) - 25 Conversions.

Is this a targeting issue, or is something else going on? Id assume even if the targeting is poor, with 26 clicks, i feel like id see at least 1 conversion. "

I'm competent in SEO (I know too much SEO and nothing else), but have never bothered to learn email marketing. I really need to learn the psychology and actual methods behind landing pages, email capturing, auto-responder campaigns, and pushing that product at the end.

Really prefer a course as I find they are concise and separate the wheat from the chaff; they are much more efficient than reading blog posts or trying to learn it on your own.

Is it common practice to use PPC intermittently? As in only using it to help launch a product and then discontinuing or pausing the Campaign? Or is there any drawback to using it one day and then not the next? Or one month on, next month off, next month on? What would the potential drawback be of this? I'm only interested in saving some money for the initial funds on my first few products then I'd be interested in using it more as I'm scaling.

257,"My Golden Rules to Email ManagementA challenge of our time is freeing up the time to do greater things in our lives that are purposeful and fulfilling.

Sometimes you get this feeling that you want to escape from behind the desk that you feel shackled to. 

The average person receives about 126 emails per day, and only 77 are really legitimate. There is a way to process through this daily assault of emails.

*""Veni, Vidi, Vici"" is the phrase I try to keep in mind when I handle email. It means ""I came, I saw, I conquered.""*

Here is how to unlock hours of email processing. 

If you are going spend longer than two minutes processing an email, then put it in a folder to process later. When you first sit down, itemize and process your emails into as few folders as possible from most important to least important.


**For example, I created 3 folders.**

1.) Email that requires a response that lasts longer than two minutes to draft.

2.) A folder where I can store things that do not need answers but are waiting for something to happen first. Much like thinking about the concept of IFTTT (If this...then that...).

3.) A folder for archive items that are valuable and may be referenced later.


**Change your mindset and change your behavior.**

* The average person types 38-40 words per minute.
* Sentences are composed of 8-11 words for easy reading. 
* Using these numbers equates to 7-10 sentences per 2 minutes. 
* Effective communication in most emails is 7-10 sentences.

Cut out the unnecessary fatty parts of the email and get to the point. 

Take Twitters approach. They limit tweets to 140 characters.


Use 7-10 sentences and convey your thoughts in a clear, concise and to the point manner.


**Be a leader through email.**

Respect the receiver by presenting a prompt, clear, concise and easy-to-read email. Your target is to keep time to a minimum in your email program so you can work on what is important."

I know, though, that when I first started out in email campaigns years ago using Constant Contact you were supposed to keep the designs to 600 pixels wide so it displays correctly on different devices.

I created a directory of pages by state that will list relevant results for that state. At the bottom of my homepage, I have a link for each state with the url /stylists-near-me/{state}.

Currently, they have little to no results other than blog content. I was hoping to gauge/publish the demand of each state in order to a) market to potential clients of stylists and b) offer the SEO perks to the stylist.

My question(s) to somebody more experienced in SEO/SEM:

1. Is this proper/ethical? My goal is to be a directory of users so it's not exactly fluff links.
2. With the majority of the landing pages being same content (no stylists currently), I imagine that will not bode well for my placements. Would fresh blog content help there or do I need to come up with something relative to each page?

**What we did well (that you can implement):**

* **Find your ideal customer, then offer them something that they can’t refuse.** Our ideal customer was entrepreneurs and people trying to start online businesses. Our offer: a free startup idea in your inbox every day. About 30&amp;#37; of all website traffic ends up subscribing.
* **Drive Traffic using relevant channels.** Our target audience was entrepreneurs, so we mostly posted on IndieHackers, Reddit, Hacker News, and Quora.

**What we can improve on:**

* **Give people a reason to come back.** Our website is just a landing page, so people are obviously not coming back. We need to fix that.
* **Get links.** This is hard. But getting a link or mention from a relevant source helps. We didn't focus on this at all, but are starting to now.

**In summary, I think its a 4 step pattern for growing your list.** 

1. Find your ideal customer
2. Build a landing page and offer that gets your ideal customer to sign up.
3. Drive traffic.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3.

429,"How do you guys deal with dumb (literally), computer-illiterate clients?Not understanding how SEO fully works and having unrealistic expectations within a short time frame is one thing. Being literally D.U.M.B. and computer-illiterate ON TOP OF THAT is another.  I have a 60-year old SEO freelance client and I swear I didn't know this guy was this dumb. He fails/refuses to follow the most basic instructions. This causes delay in trying to progress the work I do for him because he's so computer illiterate that he can't do the uttermost basic things and it frustrates the hell out of me.  You guys may be asking then why I brought him in as a client in the first place.  He was a good business partner with my uncle, was looking for SEO services for his site that sells various golf products, so i got introduced to him. Had a conversation, seemed like a good guy, explained the fundamentals of SEO, he seemed to have got it - so I took a chance, why not.

Boy do I regret this decision.

Let me give an example of what happened: He didn't know how to access his GSC property registered under the e-mail I created for him so I was more than glad to show him how to do that with clear screenshots attached. He continuously had trouble when all he had to was follow my step-by-step instructions with the screenshot attached. Then he gets frustrated and responds to me in the e-mail in all caps, 'I DON'T HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE TO DO THIS MIKE, I'M SEEING SOMETHING DIFFERENT"".

So out of mere frustration, I tell him to take a screenshot of what he's seeing on his screen. As expected, I get an ""I don't know"" answer. I give him the instructions on how to take a screenshot. 2 days later, I get a response saying he physically PRINTED OUT THE PAGE of what he saw and physically mailed it to my address. Like, who the f does this? Guy's about to give me cancer, I swear. Sorry if I'm ranting but I just don't know how to deal with and manage such a retarded client like this. All he had to do was take a quick screenshot that takes 2 seconds, attach the image to the e-mail and send it over. Why physically print the page and mail it to me?

Second example: 2 months into the contract, he sends me an e-mail in all caps once again sounding like he's flipping out, going full retard. Asks, ""WHY AM I NOT RANKING PAGE 1 FOR GOLF GLOVE WHEN I PAID YOU TO HELP ME FIX THIS"". Then of course I had to write up a concise 3 paragraph answer for him to fully comprehend and understand. Completely understandable. I had to explain to him in baby steps how the Google algorithm works (when I already did when I first met him in person), what ""keyword volume"" is, what ""keyword intent"" is, and all the different aspects of keywords tied within SEO and other SEO elements. But asides from just all of this SEO stuff, this guy is a fucking computer-illiterate dumbnut who fails to do anything with a computer other than responding to my e-mails. Another example - wanted to set up a [join.me](https://join.me) video conference call - that way it would be much easier communicating WHILE showing the material to him...literally in front of his screen with my voice. What gets better than that? Sent him the download link - and guess what. Guy had a difficult time downloading, didn't bother with instructions and just wanted to talk on the phone.

522,"OPEN QUESTION: Recover ALL deleted emails in an Outlook web account****TL;DR - help me recover my GF's emails from dead relatives by undeleting ALL emails in an outlook web app account - deleted items are 9,000+ (that's no joke) ***

My GF has somehow managed to delete ALL 9,000+ emails in her inbox... No idea how she managed this and she says she can't remember! WTF ???

Anyway she wants me to recover them because in addition to *mountains* of spam she has sentimental value emails from passed family and such in there. The problem is that the ""recover deleted emails"" option only seems to allow you to recover individual emails, and needless to say I'm not prepared to manually recover ten years worth of emails.

If I try the 'select all' check box, the options to move messages to another folder disappears in the web app version.

I logged into the account through Outlook 2013 on desktop, and this was just as bad. It won't let me move more than a few emails at once and the server takes so long to update that I can't even block-move emails manually because the client starts to get out of synch after a few moves.

I also tried copying the deleted emails folder to a new sub-folder but again it won't allow me to do that because the database file size is larger than the server will allow.

If anyone can suggest something else I'd be willing to try it. Please help!"
862,"Facebook conversion goal (scaling from ViewContent)Need some help with FB/IG conversion campaign

&amp;nbsp;

I'm having problems trying to use the conversion campaign when switching from ViewContent to AddToCart. 

&amp;nbsp;


Here are our events from last week in numbers (from our webpage):
ViewContent 5k
AddToCart 103
Initiate Checkout 68
Purchase 5

&amp;nbsp;

**BACKGROUND INFO**
We are a Small Boutique Brand with our own products (designed and produced) - advertising Interior Design products from linen/cotton bedding for babies to adults (price range 15€ to 200€) to wooden toys for kids (price range 30€ to 270€) selling worldwide.

&amp;nbsp;

**FB SETUP**
As we don't have enough Purchase events for our data set, I set up ViewContent as an Ad Set goal. I ran the set 3-4 days and it was having 30+ events (ViewContent) per day. The set has 2 ads, one image ad (with canvas for mobile) with the score of 9; the other is a slider (with canvas for mobile) with the score of 7. The budget was set to 5€ per day. During these 3-4 days there were 3 AddToCart Events and 2 Purchases.

&amp;nbsp;

**ADDITIONAL QUESTION**
Both ads in the Ad Set above are showing the same category (toys) of products (our best sellers, basically). The rest of the product categories I'll add into this Ad Set once I can make these ones work. Here I would like to know if it is better to mix ads for different products (in different categories) in the same ad set or to separate them by campaigns and run them at different times for the same audience or for different audiences?

&amp;nbsp;

**AUDIENCE**
This Ad Set is targeting our warm audience – Instagram engaged (90 days) and website visitors with more than 2 visits (excluding AddToCart and Purchase) in countries where most of our customers come from (parts of west EU, USA, Canada, AU and Japan) – the audience should be around 50-60k in size. Most of the audience comes from Instagram, where we have 94k followers. 

&amp;nbsp;

**TRYING TO SCALE**
I then changed the budget to 6€ and that put the ad set to learning mode ... so I changed the conversion event as well and set it to AddToCart. 30h later, I have 15 ViewContent and no AddToCart.

&amp;nbsp;

**QUESTION**
Is it time to switch back to ViewContent? … am I missing something? I had AddToCart and Purchase conversion goals set up earlier and never had real success – maybe I stopped it too early, I don't know anymore – how long do you let Conversion Campaigns last if they do not bring enough Events?

&amp;nbsp;

**ADDITIONAL QUESTION**
In addition, I used to target Hot Audience - people who added products to cart - with more “generic brand ads” that had a huge frequency (above 20) and produced just a couple of conversions per month (mostly view through purchases and not click). Now I've switched to Dynamic re-marketing and I do see some AddToCart, even Initiate Checkout, but I'm 3 weeks in and still no conversion. 

&amp;nbsp;

We don't offer any special incentive to get them back, though, and ads in general are more descriptive and not sales oriented (brand strategy). Our biggest emphasis is on really good looking lifestyle photos of products – since everything is catering to the design aspect. 

&amp;nbsp;

**TO RECAP**

&amp;nbsp;

- How to scale campaign – from ViewContent to AddToCart and then up… when do you know it's time for the next stage

113,"Potential client doesn't want to pay for our services because they're a charity and it's a Google Grant. Client does $6M / year in donations and has 20 full-time staff. Share your cheapskate client stories!Anyone else have a cheapskate client story to share?  
My business partner just turned down an embarrassing offer from a charity that wants to be our client.  
When my partner does sales on her own, I mentor her and only get involved once it's time to hammer out a contract.  This time, the client low-balled us, requesting a $200 per month management fee.  It was a great learning experience for her because she didn't want to say ""No.""  Although I would have been SO proud if she countered with a fair offer right away, or even turned them down, she told them that she has to discuss it with her business partner.  
Obviously, $200 doesn't even cover the cost of the time my partner and I spend discussing and reporting on the account.  Even more, a Google grants account is more difficult to manage because of the requirements to stay active. E.g. the account must stay above 5% CTR and CPC is capped at $2, among other requirements.  
She and I spoke at length about the disadvantages of discounting our work.  I explained to her that we would be forgoing future work from a well-paying client, because of our commitment to this charity; we would be choosing to work for someone that doesn't value our contribution. etc.    
So, we countered their offer with a very fair management fee which they declined, as predicted.  Their excuse is that it's too expensive for their budget.  The potential client told us that their previous PPC manager was a grad student who was doing it ""for experience"" up until the account was suspended for not meeting standards.  
Well, I did some digging on the charity and they have 20 full-time staff at their national office and do more than $6 million per year in donations.

206,"Top Email Marketing Strategies from Top SaaS CompaniesEmail marketing is still one of the best ways to help market your contents, reach new leads, and make your business known to others. But over the years, email marketing has received some fairly bad raps from annoyed individuals because of the fact that a lot of email marketers in the past abuse this tactic way too much.  
  
An article I have come across before talks about some [simple tips](https://www.smartinsights.com/email-marketing/email-communications-strategy/6-email-marketing-strategy-tips-top-280-saas-companies/) that can help you lay down a solid foundation when it comes to your email marketing strategy and avoid annoying your targets and subscribers.  

**Here is a summary of that article:**

* When they don't reply to the first email, this doesn't mean the end of your effort. For most successful SaaS companies, their email marketing lasts an average of 9 days of constant contact and sending over helpful and highly related contents.

* An average of 23 days follow up before stopping altogether on a combination of voicemails and emails techniques can yield up to 156% of closing a deal rather than just pure email campaigns.

* Avoid annoying your leads by just sending one email per day. In the past, people get annoyed with email marketings and have trouble giving their personal emails because of the fact that email marketers used to abuse this confidence they were given by sending bulk emails full of promotional campaigns. It's not easy navigating through a full inbox looking for some of your important emails. 

* Automate your marketing effort. Automating allows you to attend to other important matters. This way, you can spend enough time writing your campaigns rather than using up all your time hitting send button to individual people or fielding even the smallest and frequently asked questions.

* Use the magic number of email marketing by writing 130 words in your email campaign and make it enough to snag their attention to further click or do whatever it is you want them to do."

They're putting up a website soon - is there a reason I shouldn't just get them some hosting, setup emails in cpanel and then route them through gmail accounts (they like the interface) and set up the aliasing so it all looks like it's name@domain? I've done this for other domains I've run, but they've all been very low volume. This would be for a small business. 

Additionally, their current email is in office365 - would there be a way to transfer that email over to whichever new service I set them up with? Would hate to have to have a big start and stop for them and old emails inaccessible.

But i'm quickly realizing how messy this is going to be. I have categories set for lots of different things.... this is so that I can capture extra search traffic with these category pages.

The problem is how do I create a clean category hiearchy structure on each page if there are a ton of categories for each product?

The menu navigation will house a lot of thee links to the random category pages. 

For example a Nike T-shirt could be in categories like Nike, clothing, tshirts, athletic gear, lifestyle clothes, training apparel, nike tech fleece, nike dri fit, nike basketball, nikelab

those are all the categories and they all have purpose. but how do i add a product to all these categories but maintain a clean link hierarchy on the page like Nike / Nikelab / Product Name ?

Pushing promotions through Headline Text Ad Copy vs Sitelinks  
One of our agencies said this, what do you guys think?

* Pushing promotions through Headline Text Ad Copy vs Sitelinks - There is a trade off:  

   * **Headline** \- Copy is more visible and directly correlative to the intended experience. To run effectively, need to pause out Evergreen ads. This can hurt Quality Score and Increase CPC's - the trade off is if performance makes up more the upfront deficit. Setup requires more diligence with rotating in, scheduling the pausing/enabling of evergreen/promotion ads.  

   * **Sitelink** \- Practically the inverse option. Copy is less visible and potentially not going to show (since Google determines which Extensions show). Does not effect costs and setup is easier. Less likely to drive incremental performance.

The same feed shows 93% of the products approved for Google Shopping, so I'm guessing the rules are different when it comes to what's allowed for each one.

We have activated it, but its still way too early to tell but I do have some questions:

1. it seems to be eating up the budget that you give it, whereas our normal shopping campaign never came close ($500 a day usually only hit $100-150) is this normal for smart shopping campaigns?
2. I am not sure I fully understand the features of the smart shopping campaign yet. It sounds like a regular shopping campaign with the following: Conversion optimizer for higher ROI, Much more automated (can't even see/block keywords or what specific cpcs are), and has dynamic remarketing basically built in..
3. What exactly is the difference here compared to dynamic remarketing? It seems to be the exact same thing except lumped into one campaign. Is that wrong?

I am not opposed to letting google algorithms do their thing, I know many here will often say that they do not perform as well as manually optimized campaign and losing data is never a good thing. But I am willing to at least give it a shot, if it performs better than our regular shopping I'm all for it. Just looking to see if I understand it correctly.

556,"Having trouble vertically scaling Facebook adsSo I've had a lot of success last year during the holidays with my one of my businesses (did over $1-million in revenue in 2 months), but I'm having a bit of trouble with a new business I started this year. 

Basically, I have a buncha profitable / successful test ads, but every time I try to scale them vertically, they always flop.

I've tried duplicating the ad set and increasing the budget while setting a manual bid (I've tried both target cost and lowest cost with a bid cap), but my CPA is always double that of the test ads. This was the strategy that's always worked for me, but now it seems like it's just not getting me the same CPAs/CPPs I've been used to. 

  
Should I stick to just increasing my budget of the ad by 20% every few days? Or is there another strategy that I should try out?

I've even tried things like splitting the ads by age and then scaling those, but that hasn't been too successful either.

614,"AdWords Intellectual Property?Any help much appreciated. FYI - I am based in the UK

I own a small business &amp; have a relationship with an ad agency for running an AdWords campaign. 

I recently contacted the person I deal with to ask to suspend their services for a period of time. In my request I asked for the agency to leave my campaign live but to stop maintaining it until further notice. 

This was all okay etc. However they are refusing to leave the campaign live as ‘they built the campaign and it is therefore their intellectual property so they would be responsible if anything went wrong’. 

This has seriously soured what has to date been quite a good relationship between us from my perspective. Before I respond to them, I want to get an idea of where exactly I stand legally etc. here. If they do not revise their stance, I would honestly not continue the relationship into the future as I would consider this to be them acting in very bad faith. 

I could be going way overkill with the above but want to know what the situation actually is before I contact them about this to ask them to reconsider just in case they start being obstructive. 

To be clear: I know AdWords campaigns should be monitored at all times etc. Please do not comment on this aspect of things - the timescales involved are relatively short. 

Some maybe helpful information:

Agency created the account using a new gmail email address. 

My company’s payment details are linked to the account - the agency is ONLY paid for their services - AdWords spend goes straight from us to Google via debit card. To be clear - the agency DO NOT pay google anything in any way, shape or form. 

No formal or informal (to my memory) terms and conditions have been agreed between us and them that would cover this scenario.

479,"2 business, same client, same location, GMBI have a small client who has 2 business from his home address. He handles most of his own SEO, and I occasionally do some small ad campaigns for him
The client runs private classes/workshops from his home, which is also a B&amp;B and offers local tours. 

There is a connection between the 2, as he does sell the classes to customers that stay at the B&amp;B and take the local tours. In some cases he sells the class with accomodation included. So there is a big cross over with both business. Although the B&amp;B can be booked independently.

I've told him this is one business with multiple services, but he insists they are seperate and have a seperate website and should have seperate GMB listings, which he wants to set up himself. 

Apparantly, he has been on the phone with Google to get the business listed, and google want further proof the second business is at that location. On Google maps they can see the sign out front for the workshops.
The workshop site has a listing on GMB and shows for local searches, but the B&amp;B doesn't. 

Is there a way I can help him here? or should he just bite the bullet and accept that if Google thinks it's one listing at the address then it's one listing. 

The only other solution I could give him was to list the second address as 'apartment A' and see if Google buys it. But TBH I don't think it will fly. 

His two websites also promote each other. On the classes website there is a section for accomodation and tours, and on the B&amp;B website there is a section dedicated to classes.

907,"Few guidelines to have an empty inboxI use many email services, which includes - my office account, 3 accounts on gmail, 1 on Yahoo and 1 on apple. Handling these emails constitutes major part of my day. I get a fair amount of email each hour, and I lure in to respond as quickly as possible.

It gives me a great feeling to have a clean inbox, a feeling of peace and calm and satisfaction and I know that its with everybody. For nearly a year now, I’ve been fairly consistent about having a clean inbox.

Here are my simple steps to achieving e-mail bliss:

1) Don’t check email first thing in the morning, OR have it constantly on. I have received this advise by many but never did bothered to integrate this habit in my daily routine. Believe me, It's a great habit. This is a tip offered by many blogs, so nothing new here. Checking email first thing will get you stuck in email for awhile. Instead, do your most important thing for the day, or the thing you’ve been procrastinating on the most. Then check email. Better yet, do 2 or 3 things first. Also, if you are constantly checking email throughout the day, or it notifies you as soon as an email comes in, you will be constantly distracted and not able to focus on the task before you. I check once an hour, but you might have different needs.

2) When you check your email, dispose of each one, one at a time, RIGHT AWAY. Make a decision on what needs to be done on each email.

- If it is a junk or some forwarded email? Trash it immediately.

- Is it a long email that you just need to read for information? File it in a Read folder (or tag it Read and archive) or print it to read on the road (while waiting, for example).

- If the email requires action, make a note of the action on your to-do. Also note to check the email for info if necessary. Then archive the email. You can easily find it later when you need to do that task.

- If you can respond to it in a minute or two, do so immediately. Don’t put it off. If you wait.

- If you need to follow up on the email later, or are waiting for a response, note it on a follow up list. 

3) I have only one folder : Archive. When I respond to an email, or finish reading it if it doesn’t need response, or note it on my to-do list, I archive it. Simple as that. You could add a Read folder if you want. I usually print longer ones to read later, like during lunch or while waiting for something. 

Email bliss can be achieved by following the above simple steps."

575,"Help! Accidentally Changed My Tracking Code Last Month and my CPA Campaign Has Gone From 30 Daily Conversions to 0Hi everyone, Ive made a silly mistake with my Google Adwords Account and I need some help.

I run an ecommerce business on Shopify. I have been using Google Adwords for over 2 years and had a great max CPA campaign getting me conversions for £6 per result. 

Last month I noticed Google Adwords was not showing the same conversions as what Google Analytics was showing, so I decided to add to the tracking code to make it count orders with different order numbers (I am unsure if this is where the problem started but it was on the same day). I then went on holiday for a couple weeks and forgot to check how my Google Adwords was going.

I have noticed a pretty big drop in sales, I usually get at least 100 per day and now I am getting around 60. At first I thought it was due to me being on holiday and not putting as much effort into PPC, but now I have realised its coz my Google Adwords tracking has stopped working, and Google stopped spending any of my money as I was not making the £6 CPA I was asking for. 

I have now got the conversion tracking working again, my question is - will I need to start CPC campaign or will my CPA campaign work again?

573,"[GUIDE] Introduction to Structured Data using Schema.orgTwo weeks ago [I posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/90fb41/schemaorg_are_you_using_it_and_if_so_how/) that I was writing a piece on Schema, and was looking for some input (thanks for all the input and feedback, you guys rock!).

I put together [an introductory guide](https://www.contentkingapp.com/academy/schema/) explaining:

* What is Schema.org?
* Why should you care about Schema.org?
* What are the most popular Schema types?
* How do you implement Schema.org?
* How to test your Schema.org implementation
* What search engines support Schema.org
* Whether structured data leads to higher rankings (this will surprise you)
* Best practices from renowned SEO experts

There's a ton of articles on Schema out there, but very few of them get regular updates and are actually comprehensible for people without a solid technical background (me included).

This is version 1, I'll be extending it in the near future with more Schema types and site attributes (bread crumbs, search etc.)

I'm very curious what you think of the article: do you feel anything is incorrect or missing? Any areas which you'd like to see extended?

606,"Negative keywords with BMM campaignHey guys,

So I'm quite new to the whole PPC world but I started a new job as a paid search executive and I'm being trained at the moment. So I've been given some little exercices about various adwords best practices and I came across something I'm not sure to understand :

Let's say you sell Volcom shirts. You have pure brand campaign running for your brand name. Then you want to do a specific brand campaign for your shirts and you have these BMM :

\+Volcom +shirts

\+Volcom +shirts +online

\+Volcom +shirts +us

What would be best practices for our negative keywords in this case? Of course there's not a lot of info but all I'm trying to work out is to know how to create your list of keywords when you have a BMM campaign for your brand search.

470,"I want to show my boss how much revenue is from Google Ads — please helpI've been only playing around with PPC for half a year while also doing everything else in marketing so I haven't had the chance to specialize as much as I'd like to. Nonetheless, I set up Google Ads for the company I'm working, including: Search Ads, Remarketing Display Ads and PLA ads. I spent around $1129 on AdWords and the total transaction Value from GA is $15,572 (the total revenue from all sales where someone clicked on my ads).

Using the positon-based attribution model for all the different campaigns the revenue shows as $4,654.85, which is still a 412% ROAS. I'm still not convinced if this is trustworthy, because for example for half of our PLA search queries we rank #1 or at least the top 3 in organic, and maybe people would've clicked anyway, especially if it wasn't even a first click interaction.

I feel like the same goes for a lot of retargetting campaigns, that are hard to prove if a customer was going to buy from us anyway.

I really only feel confident about first-click interactions where we didn't show up on organic results, but otherwise I'm left wondering how effective these ads really are.

277,"Alternative to base64 Encoded Image sources (E-Mail Signatures) [OPEN QUESTION]Hello, I am trying to generate email signatures for my entire company so I am using a script to fill in an [HTML template](https://gist.github.com/TKerstiens/dd948e1ec82e073bed30fbef859a8a16) with each individual's information and generating an HTML file that I would like to use for the signature.  The generation of the HTML works fine and I can load the HTML into chrome and it displays 100% correctly.

I would prefer to not have to host these images somewhere at the moment and would like them to be embedded in the e-mail.  We can achieve this by using outlook on each individuals machine to create the signature by hand, but again we want to avoid that.  Ideally, we will generate these templates and then automatically put these files on each employee's computer so all we have to do is select the signature from outlook.

The problem we are having is that when we do this, the image does not load.  It seems that outlook won't allow base64 encoded images?  I've tried to work around this by trying to attach the image to the email and then referencing it, but this doesn't seem to work either.  I used this [template](https://gist.github.com/TKerstiens/ca4cfb2400c4516f7c256c1208e2d483).

The client I wrote on behalf of, said that it was 'inappropriate', 'unprofessional', and quote: 'You ""emphasize that I am a female speaker"" and that ""I am just asking a small favor just hear me out a bit"" - instead of us simply saying we are asking for something without needing to put extra ""please"".

So that would explain why they are coming in from non related websites?
2. In one Ad group I have Audience defined, Keywords and Demographics. I got 0 traffic and clicks for Keywords but got views and traffic from demographic only, I selected age groups etc. Does that mean Google just showed my ad to a un targeted audience of people in those age groups and ignored my other targeting?

520,"Bing now has a Display Network: here’s how to use it/not get used by it.Yeah, so Bing Ads just rolled out its “forced display network” called ‘audiences’ so it can money-grub on bad targeting with questionable results just like the Google Display Network.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/searchengineland.com/microsoft-launches-new-audience-network-audience-ads-at-bing-partner-summit-297336/amp

Now, you’re already using it if you use Bing Ads—but it’s possible no one told you.

You have to sneakily shut it off for all Bing Ads campaigns by adding a bid adjustment in campaign settings at the *very* bottom. (And if you’ve wondered why Bing Ads suddenly started spending all of your money more quickly with questionable results and a strange reporting row called “audience total, this is why).

But back to the topic at-hand. Using image extensions and Google-style propensity to turn text-based/search ads into display ads, Bing Ads’ “audience” functionality does the same thing; that is, activates display-style advertising across their partner network.

So how do you use it? Create search ads in Bing Ads and add image extensions. Give them a bid amount of 25% of what you normally would for minimal performance (that is, undercut the search ad bids so they won’t perform/spend much of anything).

Then in campaign settings, go to the bottom and add an “audience” bid adjustment of ‘increase by 300%’.
($10 bid times .25= $2.50 +300%increase[$7.50] = original $10 target bid, for example).

Welcome to the display network: back-asswords Microsoft style.

Your reporting is in the “audience total” row of most campaign/ad groups/keywords views (aka place to which your adspend has been mysteriously going for the last couple months).

I have a local postfix instance setup for the routing of email from PHP applications and for the local accounts. 

A number of the domains utilise either google apps (grandfathered as free) or windows live mail providers. These domains run PHP applications that are capable of, and do send, email (forums, custom forms etc). These apps tend to utilise the local postfix instance for sending unless they include an intelligent mail library like swiftmail.

My issue is that I'd like to get things setup correctly so that I'm avoiding the junk/spam folders of email providers. I have SPF setup and have been looking at DKIM though I'm not sure how I can deploy DKIM on this sort of split architecture - that of sending from both the hotmail/gmail servers and my own.

For the most part gmail will not junk mail, though it will add a 'via my.server.url' to the email. I notice that other companies don't seem to suffer from this (i.e. Dropbox emails will be from 'info@dropbox.com' and nothing else). Hotmail however will readily put email in Junk - even if it's sent to itself! (i.e. a 'no_reply@example.com' type email.)

669,"How to have Postfix vary the SMTP relay depending on From: address?My home network uses Postfix to send out mail via a certain outgoing SMTP server; let's call it `smtp.example.com`. It is configured in `/etc/postfix/main.cf` as

    relayhost=[smtp.example.com]:587

Although I am the only user, outgoing mail has varying From: lines depending on circumstance:

    From: tmwnn@example.com
    From: tmwnn@example.org
    From: tmwnn@example.edu

How can I have Postfix use a different outgoing server, `smtp.example.edu`, only when sending messages with the last From: line (that is, those from `tmwnn@example.edu`)? I have the appropriate lines in `/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd` already:

    smtp.example.com tmwnn@example.com:password
    smtp.example.edu tmwnn@example.edu:password

but don't know how to have Postfix automatically switch. I looked into [`/etc/postfix/sender_relay`](http://www.postfix.org/SASL_README.html), but I think that's for separate users as opposed to varying `From:` lines from one user."

766,"Agency running our GA and Adwords accounts on their domainAs the title suggests. This is more related to Google products as whole than just ppc. Decided to post here as this is more technical and active marketing sub.

Okay. So is this as bad as it sounds? I just got on board as inhouse. 


The agency that does the SEO and Adwords has created both GA and adwords accounts under their domain name and then just given us an email address (@agencyDomain) to log into.


As I understand it. There is no way to transfer the data to different (our) account domain name. For now the plan is just to create duplicate tracking for GA for the website. Duplicate tracking shouldn't be an issue. Right?


This combined with the fact that apparently there hasn't been any input from the agency about landing pages (there is none) and the search ad copy is as short as possible without any extensions. Doesn't raise much confidence in them.


At least they have been cheapish. But is this really as bad as it sounds? Basically all the historical data is lost if we ever decide to part ways. Right?"

I'm starting an eCommerce company in 6 months. I have the domain already purchased, and I'm working on the design now. Here's my question:

Is it okay for me to post articles now—before I've 'launched' the actual product—so my site can spend time climbing the rankings before the actual launch?

Any insight would be _greatly_ appreciated; I'm a software engineer, but I know most of you are probably _much_ better at SEO than I am!

664,"Page Rank: Is it okay for /general-content/ to also have all the content that is on /general-content/specific-content/?I'm building some pages with before-and-after photo galleries on them, and I'm trying to figure out the best site structure that would yield the highest ranked pages.

There is a page called `/before-and-after/`, which is an overview of all the before-and-after pages (there are maybe 15), containing links to all of these pages with short descriptions.

The more specific pages are structured like `/before-and-after/houses/`, `/before-and-after/apartments/`, etc. The `/before-and-after/` general page contains links to these sub pages.

I would think that, if `/before-and-after/` contained all the content for these specific pages that could be dynamically loaded in to the page (for instance, clicking on Houses would dynamically load in Houses content rather than loading the page `/before-and-after/houses/`), it would make  before-and-after a more useful page with a longer visit time, and could help its ranking.

I could also somehow canonicalize the more specific pages like `/before-and-after/houses/` so that they would not be hurt by the duplicate content. Or maybe I wouldn't even need more specific pages at that point.

What is the best approach here?

**A) Put houses content only on `/before-and-after/houses/` and not on `/before-and-after/`**

**B) Don't even have specific content pages, and instead put all content, including houses and  apartments content on `/before-and-after/`**

**C) Have houses and apartments content on `/before-and-after/` that can be dynamically/asynchronously loaded in, but also have more specific pages like `/before-and-after/houses/` that are canonicalized for their topic**

I'm guessing either one of these choices could work depending on the content, but I'm wondering if others have felt they've gotten better results doing this one way over another."

I noticed my site sinking in the organic results from the top of page 2/bottom of pg 1 to now the bottom of page 4 for the search term ""personal trainer Austin"". My site is https://www.completefitnessdesign.com

Nothing has been done to my site other than the usual bi weekly blog being published, which has been happening for years and years, so I figure it's got to be the August initiated Google Medic algorithm that's getting me, as that's when I noticed the start of the decline. Thankfully, my local is still atop the pile. I realize that it's aimed at health, fitness, and wellness sites, and that those who either sell products (I don't) that may be deemed suspicious, such as supplements, etc, are penalized. Others who may engage in riskier practices can be penalized without a certain level of backlinks, reviews, or other proofs of trust. As a personal trainer of over 20 years, I work on a myriad of complex issues such as ankylosing spondylitis, rehab for all joint issues, geriatric, etc, etc, etc. I train doctors, pro athletes, etc. Yes, I realize I break free of the stereotype of the job due to the complexity of my services, but is that alone enough reason to fall to the bottom of P4? Any ideas on how to bob back up to the surface over the next few months? With New Years coming in a few months, I'd like to regain my foothold on P1 or 2.

I thought I knew about SEO until subscribing to this subreddit. I have learned a lot from the posts and your experiences. I have worked as a front-end developer and I guess that created an illusion of ""oh yeah, I know about SEO"" in my mind. Anyway, this realization was good and I am really grateful to this cool community for sharing!

The reason that I am posting is to ask for your help. I will be working on a new project. It will be a non-English blog/journal with multiple authors. Competition in our niche is moderate considering the quantity of the contents out there. However, the quality of the contents is horrible, yet there are so many people reading/following these horrible contents. I believe the strongest part of this project will be the high-quality content that we will be publishing. Unfortunately, we will have no (very limited) budget but I believe doing the best we can will eventually pay off. This time I will be more on the editorial side and also be responsible for SEO. As I have mentioned, there will be multiple authors and I am planning to prepare them a documentation so that they can create the content with SEO in mind. I will do the final touches and also handle off-site optimization activities. We are going to use WordPress. Because of my past experience, I am aware of the importance of choosing the right theme and load speed of the pages and content. Regarding the WordPress SEO, I am only aware of YoastSEO plugin.

So, I am open to any kind of documentation, advice, tool suggestion etc.

47,"Expired Domain Purchase - Looking for Some AdviceI spent about $600 on an expired domain that I believe was purchased from a GoDaddy auction and then transferred to my account from the broker who bought it. I did research on the domain (albeit not enough) and everything looked clean at the time. 

Now that I've gone through and connected to Webmasters I've realized that this domain was used to host some 60,000+ ebooks, all of which were probably illegal since it looks like there were a lot of school textbooks in there (all /book.pdf pages). Furthermore, it looks like a virus was once on the site (A trojan probably in the ebooks).

Despite all of this, the site is still indexed in Google and is showing as being otherwise healthy in webmasters. I'm working on disavowing some of the bad backlinks, which it doesn't look like there were many. Almost all the backlinks I checked in Majestic looked clean and relevant to the website.

Problem is Google has still crawled all of those .pdf page extensions. None appear in the search results but Google still thinks the page exists. I've gone through and submitted an updated sitemap, while all of those pages are 404'd. 

Is there anything else I should be doing to clean up this domain? "

430,"3 Posts Competing With Each Other in SERPs I've got 3 posts that are competing with one another in SERPs.

Right now, the target keywords are similar but not 100% the same. As an example, let's say the keywords are ""apple cider recipes"" ""how to make apple cider"" and ""best homemade apple cider""

It seems that the keywords I'm targeting don't get enough volume to really have much differentiation in Google's algorithm so all 3 posts are competing. As a result, all 3 posts are in top 10 but none are in top 5.

What should I do? I've identified a few possible solutions (there are prob more, these are just the obvious ones that came to mind):

\-- delete two of the posts and then set up permanent redirects to send traffic to the third post that remains online

\-- re-work two of the posts to target more distinct keywords, as to eliminate the competition

\-- add no-index tags to 2 of the posts so they dont appear in SERPs but keep them online anyway

Anyone have thoughts on this?"

671,"SEO for beginners: why you need itTo have a SEO- optimized resource is not only trendy for any website creator but also highly necessary for website success. There are some reasons for you why you need SEO in your online resource: 

1) Organic search is usually a primary source of website traffic. People believe that GOOGLE knows everything. That\`s why they so often start their purchases from this channel. Being highly visible as a trusted resource in the search engines always works in a brand’s favor. 

2) Smart SEO helps your website get more trust and credibility. A website with beautiful and clear user experience, a website that can be easily found by search engines is usually more noticeable among thousands of its competitors. SEO is something that will help you achieve such results. 

3) Local SEO, with the growth of mobile traffic, helps you raise engagement, traffic and conversions. It aims at optimizing your digital properties for a specific vicinity, so people can find you quickly and easily, which makes them one step closer to a transaction. 

4) SEO is relatively cheap. Of course, not all things can be done for free. But, for sure, the payoff will most likely be considered in terms of a brand’s benefit and bottom line. 

5) SEO is a long-term strategy. This instrument can\`t be used for 2 or 3 months and be expected to get great results. If you choose SEO - be ready to work with it systematically - and achieve your strategic goals. 

6) SEO results can be measured. The great thing is that SEO indicators are easy to measure. You can measure almost anything with proper tracking and analytics. "

- Members can easily unsubscribe from the e-mails by either editing it in their profile **OR** e-mailing either support@website.com **/** admin@website.com **OR** by the contact form **OR the MAIN** way by simply clicking ""Unsubscribe"" which is quite clearly marked in the e-mails, it's not in the small print like many other websites do. Doing any of these will stop them receiving our e-mails however no one ever unsubscribes because they want the update because they want to get the content ASAP.

# What I am doing:

- I am sending html emails to my subscribed and verified members via Wordpress but a few members have reported that they are going into their spam folder and looking at the trace reports a lot aren't getting through...

We are now left with a halfway built home that we can't live in and stuck living in a small apartment in the city paying rent, a mortgage, utilities, lawyer fees to fight him, etc. He's made our lives a nightmare.

There is a high demand for general contractors in our area and we want to share our story with others so they do not make the mistake that we did. I have purchased two domain names that are similar to his website name. So for example, if his website name is Carver1.com, I purchased CarverOne.com and Carver1Construction.com.

Running a physical product ads in FB.

Click through is great -- engagement on landing page looks really good-- people are clicking through to products, adding a variety of products to cart  -- engagement on post shows a lot of interest too.

Only issue is, my add to cart metric is really out of wack. By no means am I trying to blame the issues on anything external, I understand this could have everything to do with the product/price/trustworthiness etc.

Right now about 2.5% of people that clicked the add to cart button have physically clicked to the next 'reached checkout' portion. 

What could be causing people to add to cart with no intention of moving forward at that high of a rate? Could it be quality of traffic?

Using a Lookalike audience (view content) from an earlier run at the same product.

I work for a reputable online ecommerce site. Recently someone reached out and offered to lease us his domain, with the idea being he'd 301 all pages on his site to ours. We would collect the massive amount of traffic, around 1m yearly visits, and hopefully convert many into subscribers/customers. 

Let's assume for example his site is [tires.com](https://tires.com) and we own [yourdailytire.com](https://yourdailytire.com) selling just one tire per day. We don't have a large sitemap with many products. Just one. So we couldn't reasonably 301 his site pages to an equally relevant page on our site - everything to the homepage.

I'm inclined to think Google would drop a lot of the rankings for his search terms and we probably wouldn't get nearly the same amount of traffic. 

The price is actually fair, if we assume that the 1m or so visits actually convert into subscribers/customers at a similar rate as our normal visitors do.

313,"Anyone getting hammered by “Google Local Services”? Any solution?Hi,

For a while, one of my biggest lead drivers has been AdWords. Recently, Google launched “Google Local Services” in my area and apart from it taking me more than a month to actually sign up, for no reason, even with daily calls to Google, it’s been extraordinarily frustrating. What I’ve been seeing is a major drop off in CTR on my AdWords campaigns - explained probably by the  “local services” bar they place at the top of the page with “google guaranteed” vendors. 

Local services listings flattens the playing field and makes it impossible to actually stand out (vs being able to write better copy, adjust bids, etc.). We’ve got a ton of honest reviews and a 5 star average, but google will just as happily display a company with a single 5 star review as “5 Stars”. If you want to be listed first, you can, for $21 per phone call - which wouldn’t be an outrageous cost, but the platform definitely encourages price shopping since every provider’s profile ultimately looks the same. 

What can be done? Any local services businesses that have been hit by this? How are you working around this? We’ve had an amazing growth year leading up to this and I feel like we’re hitting a wall with this new frustrating change. "
584,"Cross Channel Conversions Duplicate IssueHi All,

I have a question in regard to reporting/measurement that I'm hoping someone can help answer.

I am running campaigns out of FB and Google and have both reporting ticket purchases back to adwords/fb ads manager. 

My concern is that within my attribution windows, some users may click both a Google and FB ad and then purchase which would ultimately report back a conversion in both platforms and cause duplicate data which would effectively skew my ability to calculate things like ROAS and accurate sales.

How are advertisers addressing this issue? Is there 3rd party tools available that can accurately measure cross channel conversions without duplicating. 

Thanks for any help or insights!!"
61,"Need advice on segmenting contact data!Hi,

I've recently started interning at a medical conference planning company, and noticed they have a massive problem with segmentation. They target over 30,000 contacts with the same email and for a medical field, I believe it unwise to target a psychiatrist with a conference about surgery, for example. The problem is, they have already set up an entire database that doesn't include the specialty, and I'm not sure how I can go about segmenting this data without starting from scratch.

The platform they use is Constant Contact (potentially will switch them to Amazon) and they have lists for every conference they have done in the past, but that results in very small amounts of specialized contacts once I merge the files (300 or so). I have sent out a very simple survey that asks contacts to only pick specialties they are interested in but only got about 150 responses from 30,000 emails. What else can I possibly do to help this company when there are over 20 specialties? Is it unrealistic to target in this industry?

537,"Having trouble deciphering DMARC aggregate reports (xpost /r/DMARC)We have three companies that send mail for us (Google Apps, MailChimp, and SendGrid). All three of these have their `include` statements in our SPF record, and all three have DKIM records as well.

So, given our SPF and DKIM are all squared up, we're trying to deploy DMARC. We've set up a DMARC that looks like the following:

    v=DMARC1; p=none; sp=none; pct=100; rua=mailto:postmaster@example.com; aspf=s; adkim=s; fo=1; ruf=mailto:postmaster@example.com

We recently added the `ruf` tag and haven't gotten any forensic reports. But we've had `rua` for a while and have a lot of aggregate reports. FYI we never have mail sent from any sender that uses subdomains; always the root of our organizational domain.

I've loaded some into Dmarcian and I'm having trouble figuring out what it's saying.

FYI everything here is from the ""DMARC Capable"" tab on Dmarcian:

[Exhibit 1.](https://i.imgur.com/eJ9yye2.png) This is sorted by DKIM ""raw"" failures. Since Google is fully set up with DKIM, what's going on here? Are they forgetting to sign some of their messages?

[Exhibit 2.](https://i.imgur.com/MmQXCy8.png) This is sorted by SPF domain where the DMARC is unaligned. I'm not sure exactly what's going on here. We're a Google Apps domain and use gCal for stuff.

[Exhibit 3.](https://i.imgur.com/wkNxErN.png) This is the ""SPF-Identified Senders"" tab, sorted by DKIM raw failures. A bunch of different domains there, both on the SPF and DKIM side. Only the blurred ones are my domain. Again, no idea what's up here.

855,"Quality of lead vs Cost of leadMy client just updated their lead form, insurance vertical, adding more than a dozen fields.  And the conversion rate has tanked, from 33% on the old form to less than 9% on the new form.  Their reasoning was that they weren't getting quality leads, but the fields they've added are not on any of our major competitor lead-forms.  We've gone from asking prospects about the make,model and year of their vehicle along with some contact info, now we're asking about all of their accident history, current coverage, and other factors.  All the new questions have added a whole page to the multi-step form (with conditional logic up to two new pages).    
In my opinion, asking these questions doesn't create quality, it merely qualifies better; and because it better qualifies it has a higher abandon rate ( and thus higher CPL).  It makes the agent's job easier, but could it really be worth it to save the agent some time by asking these questions right at the outset? It has moved our cost per lead by over $200, and it saves maybe 5 minutes on the phone with an agent.  
The most frustrating aspect is that the client is dragging their feet on purchasing an automated quoting tool, so that we can actually serve up quotes instantly.  So we're adding all of these fields that are required to make a quote, but we're not actually providing one instantly.  The lead ultimately has to speak to an agent anyway!  
My final frustration is that I don't believe their sales team is following up on leads as well as they should.  Apparently, they are closing less than 20% of leads that come in from the web.  I've done sales and I wouldn't last if that was my close rate from warm leads.  I've told them that their sales people are probably being lazy following up on online leads, because the sales people can easily make their commissions on policy renewals.  So, I suggested he has a dedicated online sales team, or someone who is actually incentivized to nurture web leads.

254,"How To Price Paid Traffic?**Hi everyone!**

I'm just taking a course on digital marketing and there is a part that explains ""How to price paid traffic"" I'm gonna try to explain what this module says and then ask you, experienced marketers for clarification.

The course says that you need to first find (or get from the business owner) yearly value of the customer.

times

How many costumes you think you can bring them every month.

equals

your value divided 2.

equals

your service fee +ad spend 

That way you are giving them 2x ROI

**Example**

Dental Practice:

If the average patient schedules 2 appointments a year for hygiene and exams at $400/each, and then a major case every three years costing around $2500, then we can figure that your patient's lifetime value is $1,633 per year. This was calculated by taking the $400 and doubling it for the exams  and then dividing $2500 by 3 to get the yearly amount

Yearly customer Value: $1,633

The conversion formula:

10 leads = 5 Appointments 

5 Appointments = 1 customers 

10 leads = 1 customers = $1,633 a year for the dental practice

If I bring them 10 leads and they can get 5 Appointments (for whatever promotion offer that I have done on FB) 

and then they manage to convert 1 costumer from those 5 appointments, the value that they get per year is $1,633.

The course then says that if you bring them 4 costumes (40 leads) you bring the business value of $6,532 and therefore you can charge for this service up to $3,266 monthly ($2000 service fee + $1000 ad spend) and you still get them 2x ROI.

**My problem with this**

Now the problem that I have with this is, that the dental practice makes a profit of $6,532 but that's not a net profit, net profit might be 30% (and I think I'm being really generous here) that means that they actually make only $ 1,959. In this case, they would be actually losing money by paying an agency $3k a month.

I'm really struggling to understand how to set up your prices and still get the business ROI, especially for someone like restaurants where their net income is around 5%-15%.

 after all, that's the reason for offering this service, you want them to make money, but you also want to make money your self.

I hope that this question makes sense, and I really appreciate your help."

Now I'm going to start a face ads campaign and would like to use you help. 

This is what I'm thinking about how to structure the campaign:

I have already some traffic from our IG page so my pixel have some activity. The numbers from last 7 days are 379 ViewContent and 28 InitiateCheckout.

Because of that, I'm thinking about starting my campaign optimizing for WC ViewContent.

I'm gonna run 12 dynamic carousel ads for 4 days to test the following:

* 3 different copy;
* 2 placements (IG feed and Facebook News Feed);
* 2 audiences (300k people segmented by interests and demographics and 1% lookalike from 20k people who have interacted with my IG page)

Planning on running those 12 ads in 12 different adsets with a $5 daily budget. Gonna set the conversion window for 7 days so it gathers more data, since I don't have a lot of traffic yet.

After 4 days, I'm gonna select the two ads with the lowest cost/result, duplicate the adsets and set a 30$ daily budget.

So what do you guys think about my planning so far? Is it about right? Any tips?

After that, things get a little cloudy for me. What do I do after I start getting 50+ InitiateCheckout activity per week? Do I edit the adset to optimize for InitiateCheckout? Do I create a new adset and run both InitiateCheckout and ViewContent together? 

Thank you for your help!"

Our website is pretty much static, and in so far as functionality goes, it has a form element to get info from potential clients, and a pop-up chat widget that redirects the user to another site to chat with someone in our office; no back end to speak of. As far as I can tell, the website is built with Wordpress, has a custom theme (a pretty bad one with a shit ton of sloppy, outdated code, which also appears to be used and duplicated for their other clients, and almost universally relies on outside libraries to even do simple CSS animations, eg, sliding in an element from the left or right), and using plugins like Yoast to do all the heavy lifting with their SEO.

474,"Alternatives to Outlook 2016 that make searching for email easy like Gmail?Hi everyone,

We've always used Google Apps for business.  I love it as I can find email literally in 3 seconds, even from 2009 just by typing a few words I know are in it.  My business partner wanted us to switch to Office 365 a year ago but I'm having so much trouble with Outlook.  For awhile I had all mail forwarding to Gmail so I could use it instead but find that clunky.  

An example is if I go on Gmail and want to find an email about a COR (internal term) I simply type COR which immediately gives a drop down which 9/10 shows the result I want right there, otherwise if I press enter it filters to maybe 40 emails over the past year all with that term.  I can find it easily.  In Outlook however, if I type COR into the search box and press enter, it literally finds every single email.  Like 20 from every day, most nothing to do with the phrase COR.  I will set it to ""Current Mailbox"" and it will show results from sent, archive etc.  I'm constantly giving up on mail I want to find because I just can't find it.

Are there any alternatives to Outlook that work well with Exchange but that are made more for searching and finding email quickly?  I've tried Outlook advanced search but it doesn't work properly, too clunky.  I'm not looking for feedback on how to properly search in Outlook as I've been given that many times before and don't find it compares at all to Gmail, but looking more to see if there's Windows email clients that might be a bit better to use.

This was for over a month ago and I still see spammers trying to send spam to this domain. Hence, I'm wondering, why would a spammer trying to spam gullible@domain.tld hardcode the mail server they try to deliver the mail to? Why not look up the current MX-record when sending the spam?"

51,"Mac Mail - Signature - Image wrapping when attachingHere's the scaled down version of my question:

If you create a new signature in mac mail and drag in two images side by side, save it, and use that as your signature (I have to drag the signature onto 'exchange', not sure if that matters) then write a new email to yourself, it looks fine.  If you write a new email and add an attachment, it looks fine, but when you receive it you'll note that the images have wrapped to each be on a new line.

That's the core of it... more info...

I was trying to make a custom HTML signature by creating it as HTML, then making a new one in Mail, quitting out of Mail, finding the signature, replacing it's contents with my HTML, locking the file, opening Mail again... which works but gave me the same image issue as above - fine for new message, but with attachment suddenly the whole thing looks like it gets re-written - my signature is one big HTML table but what comes through the other end when you look at the raw source is html that has been broken out into other peices.

I tried various suggestions (preferring embedded images) for images using cid references, inline data base64 right on the img src property and they all had their issues.  Embedding with the span/object tag that Mail uses seemed to be the best way to do it, until I tried an attachment.

I looked into wrapping my multipart/related part in a multipart/mixed or other multipart structures, thinking I could stop the end result from breaking it up, but it seems that Mail didn't like that, everything I tried resulted in seeing nothing for that signature in Mail.

Anyway, seems more work than it should be, I wouldn't think I need to re-invent the wheel here!

780,"How to structure AdWords Display campaignsHello PPCers,

I've been pondering how to best structure Display campaigns and thought I'd ask here to get some more ideas.

Right now I've done it so that any sort of remarketing (any previous interaction with the site) is in one campaign with multiple audiences and an ad set in it's own ad group. So an example would be:

Campaign: Remarketing Campaign 2018

Ad Group 1: May Offer - The audience would be ""All Users"" and ""All Converters"" with their own adjusted bid

Ad Group 2: June Offer - Same audience as above

Ad Group 3: July Offer - Same audience as above

etc.

There would be only 1 ad group running at any particular time.

But when it comes to expanding out that to try acquire new customers I'm not 100% sure if the same sort of structure is correct. How I've done it before is something like this:

Campaign: Expand Targeting

Ad Group 1: Keywords + Topics

Ad Group 2: Similar To All Users

Ad Group 3: Custom Intent

Ad Group 4: Affinity + Keywords + Similar Audiences

etc.

Where all ad groups are running at the same time with the same ads but only 1 targeting method per ad group.

Does the above structure look alright? The reason why they are grouped up into 1 campaign is so that the Google system can eventually favour the best performing ad group/audience like the remarketing but I do also fear it might just favour the one with the highest click rate and not conversions.

Also if I were to put all targeting methods into 1 campaign that would allow me to generate enough conversion data to eventually use an automated bidding strategy, which is what I've done for remarketing campaigns.

Any help or personal insight would be greatly appreciated as I can't find a lot of literature on this online. Thanks.

For example, if I know I need, let's say, at least a 3.5-to-1 ROAS to break even with my margins, I'll optimize towards that -- anything below a 3.5-to-1 return loses money, everything above that is profitable, etc. The problem is, I don't know how to figure out what ROAS I need to break even :(

Please help, thanks!"
679,How Are They Achieving Page 1 RankI'm doing some keyword analysis and have come across some pages that are achieving page 1 rank on Google with 0 backlinks and very little link density.

139,"I've killed my site's SEO a few months ago, oh my... (Questions)I run a fansite/forum and I killed my SEO really bad. What was once easily several hundred to almost 2000 clicks per day now became a dozen if I'm lucky. I'm trying my best to recover it now using different techniques and strategies and while it would be nice to do it one at a time, there's so much to do. One instance I was always #1 for certain keywords, I was proud really! But I changed the entire site's architecture and I thought 301 would pass the SERP over but I was wrong, way wrong. It's been about 8 months since I did this, is it still recoverable if I changed the URLs back to what it was? I didn't know Google cared how far away something was from the HP but yet, another mistake. Now google has thousands of 404 pages, yet they all 301 just fine on my end. Is there hope? Webmatser tools only show less than 50 query pages in the past month and before it was tens of thousands at least. Good lord, what have I done?

​

**EDIT 1:** This thread got very large, all over the place etc... It turned out that my fatal mistake was not including canonical tags along with other minor issues which can all be resolved. RIP this will take some doing. Thank you for the help!

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT 2:** I ended up doing the canonical thing and instead of using 301 redirects for everything, i permitted the page to exist with canonical to the new page. Thankfully I'm pretty nifty with PHP so it didn't take much effort. Now Google understands how the site is structured and while not all links have returned into the top 10 listings, many have already been resolved. It's only a matter of time.  Within a few hours one of the pages that I was aiming to get listed got #5 spot. It's not #1 as it once was but it's better than being unlisted. Now I'm focusing on other SEO related techniques to boost my pages but the hard part is over. Big thanks to all your help!"

There is a customer that is trying to send email to a client of mine but is saying her emails are bouncing back with the above error.  The customer has also tried to send me an email and it has also bounced back.  My client and I are not having any trouble with sending emails.  We apparently are not receiving the customers.

The customer has her email hosted on the xxx.xxx.xxx.xx IP address. The xxx.xxx.xxx.xx address is listed in 4 blacklists according to mxtoolbox.com

To me, it sounds like the customer is the cause of the delivery failure although it looks like it is her own system kicking back the email.   Is the “xxx.xxx.xxx.xx found in spamlist” the proof it is the customer and not my clients' issue?

If it was my client's fault with being on a blacklist, shouldn’t the error message be:

994,"[Question] Google Shopping: Setting Rules for FeedsHi all,

TL;DR: setting a 'find and replace' rule for the gtin attribute on Merchant Center feeds leads to the products getting flagged for disapproval, despite the new gtin being a valid value.

I've run into a problem with our e-comm client. They use an app called ""Adwords Robot"" to automatically create a feed for Merchant Center and by extension Adwords Shopping. 

Now, I've been getting tossed a yellow flag that I'm using restricted GTINs; which upon further inspection, is true. There are over 300 products whose GTINs start with 2. So, I face the problem of having to wipe out that leading 2 for all 300 of these products. 

I figured I have two solutions. Download the .txt file that the Adwords robot creates and do a 'find and replace'. This wouldn't work because the file gets refreshed every day. The other one is creating a rule for the Feed in Merchant Center to 'find and replace' the leading 2 and leaving the remaining numbers to give me the 12-value GTIN. But, I tried this method and it led to something weird. The 'find and replace' was able to remove the leading 2 and create a valid GTIN value, but the test said those products would be disapproved. 

Has anyone had experience with this problem? Or does anyone have any input on what I may be doing wrong with my approach?

Thanks in advance."

707,"How to use Audience Insights to create better ads, get ideas for content for your blog, and form interesting partnerships One great thing about Audience Insights is that you can use if for more than just finding audiences to target. Here are some interesting ideas:

**Ads**: Use the  **Page Likes tab to** find relevant Pages and see the “tone” used in their posts and the type of photos and posts used. Be sure to check the languages tab. If you see there’s a percentage of people speaking speaking any language other than english (or your target language), you should consider translating your ads in that language (pro tip: use Dynamic Language Optimisation). 

Be sure to use dynamic creative in order to serve the best combination of ad copy and creative to the right segment of your audience.

**Content and partnerships**: In the Top **Categories tab** you will see the pages your target audience follows.  You can create content around these topics or form partnerships with people and/or brands in your niche.

The Audience Insights is a great, data-based tool that helps you confidently inform everything from your ad and targeting strategy to the content and the partnerships you can form. "

I'm going to use one of my ad groups as an example, but this is happening with all of them.

This is a search campaign, so any impression should be the result of a search, right? Or am I wrong? I don't understand how 9 impressions came from search terms but the total for the ad group is 368 impressions. Where did the other 359 impressions come from?

385,"One Way Valve/ Email Batch Importation from WWW to Air Gapped IntranetHello, working in a sensitive environment which requires a totally air-gapped intranet.

We have open source encrypted email (in www), as well as Microsoft Exchange driven email in our intranet (air-gapped).

I am trying to propose a solution where we can do a one-way push of emails from WWW to our intranet. It is almost impossible for me to convince the security people (they have the authority but often lacks the expertise to do reasonable ruling - their favourite approach is to say no to everything) that we can plug these together with a one-way sync (I know there's commercial products out there).

The method we are exploring now is - having a dedicated email account in the WWW (e.g. entrypoint@companyname.com) where people can forward emails, where these emails will be retrieved at a particular workstation, run through all sort of virus and malware check, and then mass import into the intranet's email system. 

We are currently trying to sync and make sure every email account in the WWW environment has an equivalent in the intranet, e.g. Steve Jobs will have steve.jobs@mycompanyname.com; and in the intranet (since we don't have to pay for domain in the intranet), it will be steve.jobs@mycompanyname.int, for example.

I am thinking once we are done with that, if people wanted to get a file from internet into intranet, he/she will just email the attachment to him/herself (steve.jobs@mycompanyname.com), and BCC entrypoint@ourcompanyname.com). At fixed interval or time every day (during working hours, e.g. every 30 mins or 1 hour or as per required), someone will login to entrypoint@ourcompanyname.com, manually batch download all these emails with all the attributes and attachments in tack, and import them into the intranet Microsoft Exchange. So send our the emails, we can do a transformation on the attributes to change the .com to .int as well.

This is just a hypothetical approach and I am wondering if you guys have done something like this and what's your recommendation?"

79,"Setting Up Emails to pull from API/RSSHi all! I am fairly new to the email marketing world and hoping to get some guidance. 

My company currently uses HubSpot for all of our email marketing. We have a basic set up with responsive email templates a third party set up for us. For each email blast, I have a lot of module/fields that are simple copy\-and\-pasting some information.

Recently our IT department has set up a Data Feed \(RSS Feed\) and an API that houses a good bit of this information I manually copy and paste.

I’ve been asked to find out and figure out if there is a way we can integrate one of these into our emails to cut down on the manual work. I’ve tired to do some research as well as get in contact with our HubSpot rep but I feel like I’m not really making any progress on how to go about this, or if it is even possible."

625,"Basic set up question. cPanel -&gt; Gmail forwarding set up, build up of emails on cPanelHi,

This is the small business solution currently in play, not sure if it's the best one though. We have our domain and email forwarding working through cPanel to a Gmail account (info@domain, orders@domain -&gt; us@gmail)

We've set up and verified sending through gmail as well using TLS and that's working well, however there's still a build up of email on the host server.

I'm thinking of setting up Thunderbird as a POP3 client to keep the host email server clean, is there a better way though? Sorry, quite new to this. It's manageable as it is, I'd rather not log on every month and clear out some of the old received emails though if possible.

If you press **v* the same window appears but this time the currently selected message will be moved into the choosen folder. That saves a lot of time because you don't need to scroll in your folders list and drag'n'drop your messages.

398,"Do you guys normally optimize for cost per conversion (cost per acquisition) OR conversion volume?Hi guys,

My question is universal (i.e.: applies to all sorts of advertising platform). In general, is it better to optimize for CPA or conversion volume?

Let's say a campaign had 2 ads:

Ad 1: Total spend = $5,000; conversion = 200; cost per conversion (CPA) = $25

Ad 2: Total spend = $33,750; conversion = 450; cost per conversion (CPA) = $75

So, Ad 1 has a much lower (better) CPA ($25) but lower conversion volume (200), whereas Ad 2 has a much higher conversion volume (450), but much higher (worse) CPA ($75). That's a dilemma!

(Let's just assume the differences between those 2 ads are statistically significant.)

Which one would you optimize? And what's the logic behind that?"

Greetings everyone,

Thank you for your past and future support of Unseen.  It’s because of your commitment to private and secure communications that we’ve kept our service running since 2011 and we hope to continue to provide this service for years to come.

A couple of things have changed on the internet; we’ve noticed it’s becoming more difficult for our users to connect to centralized services and we’ve also had a lot of abuse of our free accounts. To remedy these issues we are doing the following:

-Unseen, ehf is converting to a non-profit company (project) structure, it’s just not possible to run an honest service without severe interference from various entities. It will be a project staffed by volunteers and you are welcome to contribute or donate, too!  

-Effective immediately there will no new free accounts.  If you currently have a free account, you will have until September 15th to upgrade to premium or get some FLASH coins for your account and we will end the free accounts at that time.  We will have more information about the status of free accounts in the next week or two. If you can’t afford a premium account or if you feel that you qualify for a free premium account (you are a member of a persecuted group like Falun Gong meditators, oppose repressive regimes, journalist, etc), please contact support. We had so much abuse from the free accounts, it’s not fair for our staff or the Advania data center team in Iceland to continue to deal with this. We’re very sorry we have to do this.

-We will be developing a true p2p infrastructure, based on open source for chat and calling.  This will potentially include our vpn service.   

-We will be powering things with crypto coin technology using FLASH coins ( LINK REMOVED) and we will be receiving a donation of coins from them to support our efforts and our premium users.  

More info can be found in the survey, we hope you can take the time to complete it for us:

352,"How many campaigns/platforms is manageable for one person?Hello PPC!

I've been a in-house PPC specialist for just over a year now, and I was hoping to get some insight regarding managing large accounts/platforms.

Background: I've been employed by the same company for just over a year, and prior to this I learned PPC while interning at a company who used Facebook as a sole provider of app downloads. I'm talking a monthly budget of $100k, and part of a three person team (Intern, Specialist, Manager).   


My current company started PPC off fairly slow. They ran little to nothing on Facebook, Adwords or any other PPC platform prior to my arrival, which I quickly ramped up. The whole company has been extremely happy with my results, and they've given me more and more responsibility in attaining large, and sometimes lofty goals.   


Issue: I'm starting to feel worn down by the quantity of campaigns I have to manage. Our business deals with very niche audiences across thousands of locations. At any given moment I am running 50 or so FB campaigns (At one point I was running 125) with a budget in the thousands per day. Now we're planning to expand Adwords, but my time is locked into Facebook. My day-to-day work consists solely of managing what we have at this time, with little to no time set aside to try experiments, new platforms or anything that I believe would give us new avenues/ways to acquire users. I have voiced these concerns, but to little to no avail.   


Every day another task is placed in my lap, and I fully believe that despite taking the time to set up a new platform or campaign(s), I cannot give it the full attention it deserves.

What I would like to know is what is reasonable for someone to manage on their own within a 9-5 job, and what type of salary (Canada/Toronto) should I be expecting?

&amp;#x200B;

If my landing page converts at 2%, and I make a profit  of $30 for each conversion, that means - 2% of 100 = 2 conversions. 2 x $30 = $60 profit. $60 - $170 ad cost = **$ - 110 loss**

How can I not have access to the file if this is not possible in principle, maybe I have some kind of mail virus or something else?"

What are the upsides/downsides?"
216,"ConfessionI've been an email marketer for almost 10 years and I have never, ever, ever, given regulations like CASL, CAN-SPAMM or GDPR any more than a moment's thought. People subscribe to my lists, and if they don't want to receive my emails anymore, they are always free to unsubscribe. Aside from that, I've never really put much effort into it determining my compliance standing. 

What am I missing? "
10,"My company's emails are not being delivered to Gmail addresses - please help!Started about six weeks ago and has become a bigger and bigger issue in our day-to-day operations.

The attitude of our IT department is best summed up with, ""This is something on Google's end, not ours."" I'm not expecting an easy fix, but if any of you know how to go about troubleshooting this (and what information I need to have to properly articulate the problem) I would be greatly obliged.

It has become very frustrating for me and two of our satellite offices, but nobody seems interested in figuring out what the hell is going on."
542,"What is a good Analytics account structure for an SEO/SEM agency?My workplace has historically been rather unorganised when it comes to this. They've kept one e-mail with a bunch of accounts tied to it, and several account managers could access that e-mail.

I'm now in a position where I can influence this, and I don't feel comfortable with multiple people having access to one e-mail account. 

Should every client account be on a separate e-mail/Google account? Should one account hold them all, and should individual managers be invited to individual accounts on a case-by-case basis? 

Advice appreciated!"
