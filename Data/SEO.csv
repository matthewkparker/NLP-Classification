I noticed my site sinking in the organic results from the top of page 2/bottom of pg 1 to now the bottom of page 4 for the search term ""personal trainer Austin"". My site is https://www.completefitnessdesign.com

Nothing has been done to my site other than the usual bi weekly blog being published, which has been happening for years and years, so I figure it's got to be the August initiated Google Medic algorithm that's getting me, as that's when I noticed the start of the decline. Thankfully, my local is still atop the pile. I realize that it's aimed at health, fitness, and wellness sites, and that those who either sell products (I don't) that may be deemed suspicious, such as supplements, etc, are penalized. Others who may engage in riskier practices can be penalized without a certain level of backlinks, reviews, or other proofs of trust. As a personal trainer of over 20 years, I work on a myriad of complex issues such as ankylosing spondylitis, rehab for all joint issues, geriatric, etc, etc, etc. I train doctors, pro athletes, etc. Yes, I realize I break free of the stereotype of the job due to the complexity of my services, but is that alone enough reason to fall to the bottom of P4? Any ideas on how to bob back up to the surface over the next few months? With New Years coming in a few months, I'd like to regain my foothold on P1 or 2.

I'm not the expert that a lot of others are, but I have been doing this for a while with broad experience across verticals for small and large sites. 

I'm trying to figure out how to fix this issue. I'm doing it for a friend and as you know no good deed goes unpunished. 

The question is: what should I try or look for to fix this?

Details:

Company name is the keyword target. Basically the company name would be similar in structure like a hypothetical example of ""Chicago Orthopedics"" 

The domain is the company name. It has existed for 10 years. 

Call to action link above in slider goes to the contact page. 

Home page has unique intro text about 400 char that works well in the design. It mentions the company name twice and the location 1 additional time. H1 is primary keyword.

Other text on the home page include navigation at the top to:  
\- services, about, contact &amp; link to sister site

\- list of services in grid, with link from each service to the service page. Some use the natural variation of the keyword without the location since it is relevant, others don't. ex: Physical Therapy or whatever. Nothing looks spammy and they link to 1 services page which lists the services so there isn't a bunch of thin ""Chicago X"" type of pages. Just 1 page that lists the services. 

About page has more text naturally. About 1800 char. H1 is ""About Us"" H2 is ""Meet Our Team"" and another H2 with no keywords. It basically mentions the company name (that keyword, linked to the home page which I added recently to try and steer some relevance to the primary page) in some intro text and has bios for the company's employees. It mentions the service version of the keyword without location (Ex: Orthopedics) in some of the bios.

Meta descriptions are appropriate, not keyword stuffed, etc. 

I have tried a bunch of stuff to get the home page to rank instead of the about page, including: 

1. Changed the about page URL &amp; content, 301 old one to home page.
2. Added (currently there) Canonical tag on about page pointing to homepage
3. Added (currently there) link from the about page to the home page with the keyword term which is also the company name.  

Nothing seemed to make any difference. The new about page URL outranks the home page. 

There are no manual actions, the site is indexed fine, and a keyword search with site operator shows the home page first. (ex: chicago orthopedics site:chicagoorthopedics.com and orthopedics site:chicagoorthopedics.com)   
I can't find any toxic links to it. There's 1 blog where it's a blogroll link but I don't think it's a bad site. SEMrush toxic score is 38 (just one measure I know) and other sites have shown a nice boost from a link on this same blogroll. 

I mentioned a sister site. This is using the exact same design code &amp; architecture with different content. The only real difference is that it has 1 person on the about page so it is more of a personal service provider site. It is another service the owner provides. Let's say that is ""Chicago Physical Therapy"" and has a similar domain as above, chicagophysicaltherapy.com which it does. 

The sister site, which is virtually similar ranks just as desired with the home page for the single targeted term. They're cross linked from between the sites using just the service name in navigation, not location. ex: ""Physical Therapy"" from the Orthopedics site links here and ""Orthopedics"" from the PT site links to the other one. This sister site domain is 2 years old. 

Both sites have approx the same ratio of links to home page vs about or any other sub pages, and the same ratio of keyword to non-keyword terms in links. 

So, what should I try next?

&lt;p&gt;About page has more text naturally. About 1800 char. H1 is &amp;quot;About Us&amp;quot; H2 is &amp;quot;Meet Our Team&amp;quot; and another H2 with no keywords. It basically mentions the company name (that keyword, linked to the home page which I added recently to try and steer some relevance to the primary page) in some intro text and has bios for the company&amp;#39;s employees. It mentions the service version of the keyword without location (Ex: Orthopedics) in some of the bios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meta descriptions are appropriate, not keyword stuffed, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried a bunch of stuff to get the home page to rank instead of the about page, including: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed the about page URL &amp;amp; content, 301 old one to home page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added (currently there) Canonical tag on about page pointing to homepage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added (currently there) link from the about page to the home page with the keyword term which is also the company name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing seemed to make any difference. The new about page URL outranks the home page. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no manual actions, the site is indexed fine, and a keyword search with site operator shows the home page first. (ex: chicago orthopedics site:chicagoorthopedics.com and orthopedics site:chicagoorthopedics.com)&lt;br/&gt;
I can&amp;#39;t find any toxic links to it. There&amp;#39;s 1 blog where it&amp;#39;s a blogroll link but I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s a bad site. SEMrush toxic score is 38 (just one measure I know) and other sites have shown a nice boost from a link on this same blogroll. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned a sister site. This is using the exact same design code &amp;amp; architecture with different content. The only real difference is that it has 1 person on the about page so it is more of a personal service provider site. It is another service the owner provides. Let&amp;#39;s say that is &amp;quot;Chicago Physical Therapy&amp;quot; and has a similar domain as above, chicagophysicaltherapy.com which it does. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sister site, which is virtually similar ranks just as desired with the home page for the single targeted term. They&amp;#39;re cross linked from between the sites using just the service name in navigation, not location. ex: &amp;quot;Physical Therapy&amp;quot; from the Orthopedics site links here and &amp;quot;Orthopedics&amp;quot; from the PT site links to the other one. This sister site domain is 2 years old. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both sites have approx the same ratio of links to home page vs about or any other sub pages, and the same ratio of keyword to non-keyword terms in links. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what should I try next?&lt;/p&gt;

So, I've had this blog on Google Blogger for quite some time now. Let's call it example.blogspot.com. It's indexed on Google Search, added to my Search Console account along with blogger perks like HTTPS and stuff.

Today, I bought a custom domain, say example.com, directly from Blogger's 'set up a custom domain' option using Google Domains.

The transition went fine, HTTPS was enabled, so was DNSSEC and now 

example.com redirect to https://www.example.com

www.example.com redirects to https://www.example.com

example.blogspot.com redirects to https://www.example.com


**I added the 'https://www.example.com' property to Search Console. Also, there was an option of 'change of address' when I opened 'example.blogspot.com' property in Search console which had the following options**

1. pick your new site from the list - already selected www.example.com

2. confirm that 301 redirects work properly - already confirmed

3. check that verification methods are still present - the website www.example.com was verified to my account using Google Domains so I 'Confirmed' this one.

4. Submit the change of address request - Submitted.


**Now, here are some of my question.**

1. Will I run into any trouble for duplicate content? All my redirects are working and the default site is 'www.example.com' permanently.
2. Do I have to set up a canonical URL? If yes, how do I do it? 
3. Do I have to request removal of the links already submitted to the Search Index (using Fetch as Google tool) or will it automatically update due to the 'Change of Address' submission.
4. If I have to submit new links from my blog to the Index, I should use the 'www.example.com' property instead of 'example.blogspot.com'. Right?

Hi everyone,

​

​

A group of us have recently launched a unique subReddit and we'd like to connect with you guys as the SEO experts. Why? Well, because our sub is dedicated to a single project - **combining Reddit's vast array of talents &amp; backgrounds to build a 1 business at a time**.

​

* Together as Redditors.
* From scratch: crowdsourcing the idea...
* ...to market execution (financially backed with $100k)

​

​

Businesses start with an idea and then get talent. We're doing the opposite - looking for talent first. Then, we'll crowdsource business ideas, have a voting process, analyze its viability, delegate roles/responsibilities/titles as necessary, and of course...take it to **full market execution**.

​

We've talked to some prominent advisors and consultants, and we're pretty optimistic on what may become of this.

​

So we'd love if we could have some of you guys join us to help us mold what our community will become.

​

​

​

Our sub is /TheBusinessGroup: [https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBusinessGroup/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBusinessGroup/)

​

​

We hope to see some of you there :)

Titles of all its pages in search results have something extra attached to them, so it looks something like this: ""Webpage title - long mysterious phrase"". The prase is the same on all websites and it seems like it's set to appear automatically.

    &lt;a href=""http://seo-agency-website/seo-search-engine-optimization/""&gt;SEO / Search Engine Optimization&lt;/a&gt;

While i'd find it absolutely OK to put a (single) backlink to their own site on the sites of their client, i find these links a bit shady. To me this looks, that the SEO agency is using their client's site to boost their own ranking with the linked keywords. Furthermore this smells a lot like ranking-manipulation to me - and probably also Google. Might this even result in Google penalizing my friend's website?

1. Outreach via their contact form/email.
2. Few hacky ways like infographic submission or scholarship link building (which seems to be totally useless now)
3. Finding brokers and dealing with them for guest post links in bulk

And here are few things why it sucked always:

* These brokers deliver really shitty links and it becomes difficult few times to remove such links.
* Negotiation time is too much. Discovering new blogs is such a pain in the ass.

So I've built a product (thanks to WordPress API's) which allows anyone to post any article on WordPress enabled blog in few seconds. All you have to do is:

1. Go on [https://pressly.me](https://pressly.me)
2. Signup and compose your first guest post (You can add links, medias and whatever you want)
3. Select blogs where you want to publish this piece of content
4. Pay and hit ""Publish"" and your guest post is live instantly.

Here is how it works in the backend:

* Bloggers who want to monetize their blogs are partnered with Pressly and they have setup a fixed cost for guest post.
* Since they have enabled their Wp APIs and created user for Pressly, getting post published takes literally 3 second.

It's just the first week of this product and I have managed to partner with 50+ websites (mostly they are in tech/crypto niche) but its growing like crazy.

Do check out Pressly and share your experience of doing guest/sponsored post submission with them. I'm 200% sure that you'll be surprised after using this product for guest posting.

PS: If you are a blogger, you can get partnered with Pressly.me by contacting them on prateek@pressly.me

I have taken a lot of photos for local businesses here in NYC and New Jersey. My standard practice is to just pass images over to them so they can choose how they want to 'represent' themselves via photography.

1. Should I be uploading the images myself to their business page and taging myself? Obviously it will be good if other business see that I took it, but more importantly, does that do anything for SEO ranking? I have a pano I took for a local coffee shop and it's got 50k hits so far. It needs to be updated as well, so I'm curious about how important that link is, especially if we take it down and redo it.

2. What is the best approach to expressing to clients that I shoot in NYC all the time without painting it in big bold letters in my business name like, Darren Phillip Jones Photography, Yes... YES I shoot in NYC. Please don't ignore me because my address says NJ. My friend rents in Hell's Kitchen, and said I could use his address, but I don't know how reliable that is since he just rents there.

3. Does it help to photograph local attractions and tag my business? I'm trying to figure out how to increase my rankings outside of hoping a big agency picks me up and remembers to tag my site. That's actually a big issue for me as well. I have been published in some crazy big magazines, high traffic sites... but article writers always 'forget' to credit me and back link to my site. And I am lucky if I find one of my photos used without tagging. Tracking all of my images would be a nightmare.

4. Do any of you know of a decent service that tracks photos that doesn't cost a fortune? And a good practice with it? I know of 1-2 services, but they are pricey, and not reliable. Especially since people resize everything, it doesn't always catch. I even found one of my photos in the wild, and exported to the same size, and it still didn't catch it.

I did google 'Photographer SEO' to see what comes up, but a lot of it was super basic info, like making sure to blog and tag photos! And include photographer in your keywords!

If you have any tips or advice, I'm all ears! And if you're in the NYC area and would like to possibly trade services, let me know. I don't have a lot of disposable cash, but I'd love to help you, whoever you are, out in return.

I've been collecting some data from Google for a while now, however i noticed that there is a certain limit with the search results. I tried increasing it from the Search settings and it did, but it's still not enough !

I was hoping if any of you can point out to me a way to increase the number of results either directly from the search engine or through a program!

This is quite a mess, a confusing tale I tell.

In mid to late July, I changed the url of a page to something very similar (for SEO purposes) and set up a 301 redirect from the previous URL to the new one. 

Within the last couple of weeks, I noticed that the page has completely fallen out of the rankings altogether. When I Google searched for the new URL, the top listing was the old URL, but the exact new URL is not to be found. The page was last indexed early July, before I changed the URL.

I looked in my .htaccess and remembered that at some point in the past I had used the new URL for an old version of the site, and that redirect was still in my .htaccess file. So, I had a looping problem: URL A redirects to URL B redirects to URL A. I quickly deleted the original redirect, leaving only URL B redirecting to URL A.

I then used Google Search Console's Index Coverage tool and discovered that the new URL is Excluded, type: ""Page with Redirect"". I inspected that page using the same tool and discovered that the User-directed canonical and the google-declared canonical are the same, the old URL.

Is this purely a redirect issue that will resolve if I request a new crawl from Google? If so, is there a drawback to doing that?

Or have my mistakes caused a huge canonical mess? If so, how do i resolve it?

Thanks very much!

I have an on page SEO question that’s been bugging me and I do hope you’ll be able to help.

&amp;#x200B;

I have an ecommerce site that sells to USA/Thailand

&amp;#x200B;

My question would be on the page structure that I would use to target these countries. Now Country TLD is not possible in my case (.uk,.vn,.th) and I am going with subfolders and I feel it helps just a little bit more than a sub domain.

​

The main business will Be targeting in the USA, with a single payment processor for all regions

​

So here is what I cannot decide on the URL structure

&amp;#x200B;

Option 1.

&amp;#x200B;

Have a landing page targeting the different countries other than USA.

eg. [abc.com/buy-item-thailand](https://abc.com/buy-item-thailand)

​

examples :

[https://www.exabytes.com/philippines-web-hosting](https://www.exabytes.com/philippines-web-hosting)

[https://www.uavsystemsinternational.com/drones-sale-thailand-buying-drones-thailand/](https://www.uavsystemsinternational.com/drones-sale-thailand-buying-drones-thailand/)

&amp;#x200B;

I will build links to these landing pages for thai rankings as I will be using the same payment processor for all countries

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Option 2

&amp;#x200B;

URL : Abc.com/th/buy-product

&amp;#x200B;

This option will be an entire separate site focused to the thai region

One benefit i think of this, is that I can have a separate blog just creating thai specific content while my main site abc.com creates US content. I would also be able to get country specific sitelinks to appear in the SERP as opposed to a landing page as well as create lots more of country specific content

​

examples :  [https://www.adidas.com/us/men-shoes](https://www.adidas.com/us/men-shoes)

​

Option 3

Abc.com/th/en-th

This is even more language and country specific but I am wondering if there are too many layers diluting my content as the product page will look something like

[Abc.com/th/en-th/buy-product](https://Abc.com/th/en-th/buy-product)

​

example :

[https://www.nike.com/th/en\_th/](https://www.nike.com/sg/en_gb/)

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance for your advice :)

&lt;p&gt;I have an on page SEO question that’s been bugging me and I do hope you’ll be able to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have an ecommerce site that sells to USA/Thailand&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question would be on the page structure that I would use to target these countries. Now Country TLD is not possible in my case (.uk,.vn,.th) and I am going with subfolders and I feel it helps just a little bit more than a sub domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main business will Be targeting in the USA, with a single payment processor for all regions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here is what I cannot decide on the URL structure&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Option 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a landing page targeting the different countries other than USA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;eg. &lt;a href=""https://abc.com/buy-item-thailand""&gt;abc.com/buy-item-thailand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;examples :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.exabytes.com/philippines-web-hosting""&gt;https://www.exabytes.com/philippines-web-hosting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.uavsystemsinternational.com/drones-sale-thailand-buying-drones-thailand/""&gt;https://www.uavsystemsinternational.com/drones-sale-thailand-buying-drones-thailand/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will build links to these landing pages for thai rankings as I will be using the same payment processor for all countries&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Option 2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;URL : Abc.com/th/buy-product&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This option will be an entire separate site focused to the thai region&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One benefit i think of this, is that I can have a separate blog just creating thai specific content while my main site abc.com creates US content. I would also be able to get country specific sitelinks to appear in the SERP as opposed to a landing page as well as create lots more of country specific content&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;examples :  &lt;a href=""https://www.adidas.com/us/men-shoes""&gt;https://www.adidas.com/us/men-shoes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Option 3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abc.com/th/en-th&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is even more language and country specific but I am wondering if there are too many layers diluting my content as the product page will look something like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://Abc.com/th/en-th/buy-product""&gt;Abc.com/th/en-th/buy-product&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;example :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.nike.com/sg/en_gb/""&gt;https://www.nike.com/th/en_th/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance for your advice :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are considering disabling this section in the mobile view. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this is just &amp;quot;hiding&amp;quot; it, rather than deleting it, will it still remain there for purposes of mobile SEO?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know!&lt;br/&gt;
Thank you guys &amp;amp; girls, &lt;/p&gt;

**EDIT 1:** This thread got very large, all over the place etc... It turned out that my fatal mistake was not including canonical tags along with other minor issues which can all be resolved. RIP this will take some doing. Thank you for the help!

**EDIT 2:** I ended up doing the canonical thing and instead of using 301 redirects for everything, i permitted the page to exist with canonical to the new page. Thankfully I'm pretty nifty with PHP so it didn't take much effort. Now Google understands how the site is structured and while not all links have returned into the top 10 listings, many have already been resolved. It's only a matter of time.  Within a few hours one of the pages that I was aiming to get listed got #5 spot. It's not #1 as it once was but it's better than being unlisted.

But all social media sites have nofollow backlinks. And I'm told I should NEVER buy backlinks, even from high DA sellers on fiverr for example.

Looking for some suggestions on how can a solopreneur scale SEO like authority sites do?

Some concrete examples:

Guest posting: Scored some great links but diminishing return after a few articles. Focus on gaining referral domains instead but constant outreach (for new sites) takes too much time, more than writing the article itself. Also taking time away from writing for my own site.

Media outreach: Also very time consuming, success rate being low and sometimes you don't get link, or a no-follow.

Citations: Quality ones already done, ranking in 3-pack for those searching in my area. Don't need hundreds and certainly don't want spammy citations.

PBNs: Nearly all competitors in my niche are relying on PBNs more or less, mixed results. It's like a drug, the juice feels great at the beginning then you keep adding until you die from overdose. Having too many homepage PBN links is a dangerous footprint anyway?

Yes SEO works but everything I have done so far feels like a linear (time consuming) approach.

1. Why are you interested in this position? How does your previous experience relate to this position?

2. What can you tell me about your writing process and how do you deal with writing for an audience you are not well acquainted with?

3. What makes good writing? How do you know if a piece of content is performing well?

4. Can you give us one example of how you pulled a story idea back from what you felt was certain failure?

5. When you receive a document to edit, how do you approach the process? What are you strengths and weaknesses as an editor?

6. How do you balance independent thinking and cooperation with others? Share an example.

7. What is your experience with content strategy and SEO? How have you used these to increase the reach and impact of your content?

8. What is this first thing you do to optimize your work for search?

I will try to keep on track as not to bore you. I will also try to keep companies, products and SEO companies vague as to not go against the rules.

* I have created a website for a family business. We are busy at our physical location, but wanted to try an online store. Our top selling product is X (not sure on the rules about listing products/websites)
* I've been using Neil Patel's SEO autochecker, scoring an 89. I can get this over 90 with some tweaking I'm sure.
* When compared to the top 3 websites on google selling product X, I out rank them anywhere from 3-20+ points. 
* My website is showing 0 errors and less warnings than all the other websites.
* All the other websites have more backlinks than me.
Now comes the questions.
* Out of the 3, I rank higher than 2 of them because of back links.
* I've been in contact with an SEO company that says my site is fast, and doesn't seem to be any issues, but also said there is a problem with traffic and back links.
* The said SEO company wants to charge me 500/month to up my ranking.
* SEO company also said that I should not engage with ad words as for my keyword they are $10+. I have confirmed this, as I was using adwords. SEO Company said that other companies selling the product are just outbidding each other on adwords and not optimizing their site.

Now for the questions:

1. Is NP's SEO autochecker a good site to use to get a rough estimate of where you stand in rankings?
2. In terms of SEO companies, do they ask you to make changes to your website to satisfy some SEO tests?
3. If it is against Google's terms to buy back links, how does SEO companies increase my back links if not from buying them?
4. At this point with my site ""optimized"" more than my competition, should I still hire an SEO company or is my money better going elsewhere to gain traction (ads, etc...)?


Apologies if some of these questions seem obvious. I can give more info if needed.

Currently, the company website is the first result, the second is the consumer affairs review page that we pay to submit our customer reviews to (positive), and third/fourth is our facebook/linkdin pages. After this though, there are several negative links, one from a forum asking about the company, one from ripoffreport etc.

&amp;#x200B;

On the second page, there are links to some of our other properties. One is a secondary website that doesn't have much purpose and isn't updated much, another is a youtube video on our channel, and then our twitter.

So my question is, if my task is to get those positive links on the third page to make their way above the bad links and get to the first page, 1) is that even a reasonable task? and 2) what could I suggest doing to accomplish this?

My boss insists that we should create accounts on multiple social/bookmarking sites like reddit, digg, and other nonsense and just submit links to the pages we want to increase the ranking of. To me, this sounds absurd to think that we would be spamming the link to our twitter somewhere that no one will read it and this could someone help our rank.

What are some realistic options? Is it even possible to get a single page like a youtube video to rank higher?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the only computer person (web designer) at work, I&amp;#39;m in charge of a project to improve what shows up when someone googles our company. Currently, the company website is the first result, the second is the consumer affairs review page that we pay to submit our customer reviews to (positive), and third/fourth is our facebook/linkdin pages. After this though, there are several negative links, one from a forum asking about the company, one from ripoffreport etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the second page, there are links to some of our other properties. One is a secondary website that doesn&amp;#39;t have much purpose and isn&amp;#39;t updated much, another is a youtube video on our channel, and then our twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my question is, if my task is to get those positive links on the third page to make their way above the bad links and get to the first page, 1) is that even a reasonable task? and 2) what could I suggest doing to accomplish this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My boss insists that we should create accounts on multiple social/bookmarking sites like reddit, digg, and other nonsense and just submit links to the pages we want to increase the ranking of. To me, this sounds absurd to think that we would be spamming the link to our twitter somewhere that no one will read it and this could someone help our rank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are some realistic options? Is it even possible to get a single page like a youtube video to rank higher?&lt;/p&gt;

What I would like to do:

Advertise a new page on Google that contains all the same information as my product page currently does including the meta description, product images and title, but when a customer clicks on the ad they are instead redirected to my actual product page which contains a much cleaner less term heavy description. I have old URLs that we used to use for our products, and they currently just redirect to the updated product page but we do not advertise them.

Why I would like to do this:

* Title: Including key terms in a product title is necessary for visibility on most marketplaces, but on a product page I feel the title should simply be the product title and nothing else. Any key terms and information about the product should be in the description or in the images.
* Images: In a product highlight page, I do not want to be limited to square, white background images without text or backgrounds. Additionally, the images for our mobile website need to be different than the desktop version, but Google does not allow me to manually upload images to the feed that I'm aware of; having the same image twice in a different aspect would not be beneficial
* Multiple Pages: Currently Google will only allow us to advertise our product once despite their being different colors because the products all reside on the same URL, submitting the products twice violates Google's policy on duplicate listings as well as the images all being submitted on the same ad (so blue may appear as black because Google is snagging all the images on the page). If this method is viable, I would be able to feed different URLs for each of my products, and have them all redirect to the main page once the ad is clicked on.

I have researched this vehemently and cannot get a straight answer on whether this is possible, against policy or if there is an easier way. Google is strategically vague on this matter as far as policy which is no doubt to be able to take down listings as they see fit without allowing any clear workarounds.

**Seconds:**

What is the golden number for:

* desktop
* mobile

I've read that 2seconds is best for desktop and from 3 to 4 seconds is best for mobile, but it seems to me a bit impossible for larger sites.

&amp;#x200B;

**Metrics:**

What metric should we use. I just started devouring this subject and I found so many metrics about the site speed like Avg. page load time (sec), TTFB (Time to first byte), PageSpeed insights' Optimization metric like 77 / 100.

Also should I trust Google Analytics' data for site speed.

&amp;#x200B;

**How to test site speed if we are not inhabiting the particular country:**

Like for example I'm from Bulgaria and I want to test the speed of the site in South Africa. In Bulgaria the internet connection is really fast compared to other countries and I can't be sure if the average user is experiencing problem with the page load.

Many sites for testing give me various results. How can I know the true site speed?

&lt;p&gt;I posted over on &lt;a href=""/r/Entrepreneur""&gt;/r/Entrepreneur&lt;/a&gt; last Sunday &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/98j7tu/uk_it_job_board_advice_feedback/""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/98j7tu/uk_it_job_board_advice_feedback/&lt;/a&gt; that i&amp;#39;ve built an IT Job search engine for UK jobs &lt;a href=""/r/http""&gt;r/http&lt;/a&gt;://&lt;a href=""http://www.kodr.com""&gt;www.kodr.com&lt;/a&gt; and was looking for any feedback and direction where to go next. The main point that came up is SEO, something i have no experience with. The site is far from finished, but it is at a point where i can now promote and make small daily increments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve briefly looked on &lt;a href=""https://fiverr.com""&gt;fiverr.com&lt;/a&gt; for some freelancers to do some audits - thoughts were to pay 4 or 5 to do some basic/standard audits and go from there. Is this a waste of money? Can you recommend a better course of action and efficient use of money to spend? Being a web dev myself i can do a lot of the work that would come up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your help!&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

So I got hired as the SEO at this digital marketing company, it's a small one (max. 10 people). Monday was my first day here.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is I worked before (for one year and a half) in a similar company, but I only did one thing there: link building, and guest posting was the main technique.

&amp;#x200B;

For now I have to take care of a site that sells puppies. So this is kind of an online store.

After 2-3 days of talking different ideas and me trying to get something right, we kind of got to the conclusion that I should take care of guest posting (meaning what I did before coming here) for the next few days and see how I can manage that and what results I will have.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I kinda got the impression that I need fast results (meaning what fast means for SEO). So, are there any tips you could give me? What are the things I should keep in mind at all time? Are there any insightful article/s that would address this exact matter? Meaning what I should do right now to help my ecommerce site rank better now?

Are there any other techniques I should try in order to make the site rank better (for instance I thought about making a Pinterest Business account and manage that for let's say 30 minutes a day)?

I'm currently the founder of StudentSpin, a completely Student-run magazine/publication organization. What makes us truly unique is the fact that we are all students in High School, from our founding team all the way down to our daily posters and writers. We publish monthly magazines as well as many weekly posts.

Since our whole website only specializes in wall art and since there isn't even that much of search volume in our targeted geographical location (only about 1.6k a month), we need to rank our homepage (which contains products and products categories) in the #1 spot. 

Anyways, one thing we have avoided so far is to write blog posts with long tail keywords that contain ""wall art"". For example ""Modren wall art"" or ""7 tips to choose the right wall art"" and so on. This is because we are afraid these posts would end up outranking or competing with our home page which is mostly products and not a lot text to optimize for (as with any online store homepage)

Question is, will writing a blog post with the focus keyword ""new trends in wall art"" poses any risk to the ability of the homepage to rank for ""wall art"" or will that actually enhances home page ranking for the seed keyword ?

This is because we are afraid these posts would end up outranking or competing with our home page which is mostly products and not a lot text to optimize for (as with any online store homepage)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question is, will writing a blog post with the focus keyword &amp;quot;new trends in wall art&amp;quot; poses any risk to the ability of the homepage to rank for &amp;quot;wall art&amp;quot; or will that actually enhances home page ranking for the seed keyword ? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advances. &lt;/p&gt;

* Get some quality articles written about the subject of the website and put those up (will be redirected to relevant pages when site launches, likely different URLs but similar content)

I usually find these things through copyscape, and most of my requests through the Google dmca Dashboard are successful.

But here's a new trend... the webmasters for the crappy websites are replying to Google and saying that it is their content, or that they do not have any infringing content and therefore the claim is unmerited.

So what does Google do in that situation? They email you and tell you that you need a subpoena in order to get the content removed.

In other words, as long as the webmaster for the spammy site replies to Google that they have put in a good faith effort to identify any infringing content, and they no longer are in violation, then Google drops the case. They don't actually bother to follow up and see whether they really have removed the content.

The most recent time this happened, it was a very blatant copyright issue that continues to exist. Of course, I have sent Google all of the necessary information including screenshots of our two different sites next to each other to demonstrate the copyright infringement.

The moral of the story is, if you own a crappy website that plagiarizes content, then all you need to do is reply to any Google removal request and say that it is unmerited. And if the original copyright owner does not hire a lawyer, then Google will basically do nothing for them. And your crappy site will remain indexed.

He fails/refuses to follow the most basic instructions. This causes delay in trying to progress the work I do for him because he's so computer illiterate that he can't do the uttermost basic things and it frustrates the hell out of me.  You guys may be asking then why I brought him in as a client in the first place.  He was a good business partner with my uncle, was looking for SEO services for his site that sells various golf products, so i got introduced to him. Had a conversation, seemed like a good guy, explained the fundamentals of SEO, he seemed to have got it - so I took a chance, why not.

Boy do I regret this decision.

Let me give an example of what happened: He didn't know how to access his GSC property registered under the e-mail I created for him so I was more than glad to show him how to do that with clear screenshots attached. He continuously had trouble when all he had to was follow my step-by-step instructions with the screenshot attached. Then he gets frustrated and responds to me in the e-mail in all caps, 'I DON'T HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE TO DO THIS MIKE, I'M SEEING SOMETHING DIFFERENT"".

So out of mere frustration, I tell him to take a screenshot of what he's seeing on his screen. As expected, I get an ""I don't know"" answer. I give him the instructions on how to take a screenshot. 2 days later, I get a response saying he physically PRINTED OUT THE PAGE of what he saw and physically mailed it to my address. Like, who the f does this? Guy's about to give me cancer, I swear. Sorry if I'm ranting but I just don't know how to deal with and manage such a retarded client like this. All he had to do was take a quick screenshot that takes 2 seconds, attach the image to the e-mail and send it over. Why physically print the page and mail it to me?

Second example: 2 months into the contract, he sends me an e-mail in all caps once again sounding like he's flipping out, going full retard. Asks, ""WHY AM I NOT RANKING PAGE 1 FOR GOLF GLOVE WHEN I PAID YOU TO HELP ME FIX THIS"". Then of course I had to write up a concise 3 paragraph answer for him to fully comprehend and understand. Completely understandable. I had to explain to him in baby steps how the Google algorithm works (when I already did when I first met him in person), what ""keyword volume"" is, what ""keyword intent"" is, and all the different aspects of keywords tied within SEO and other SEO elements. But asides from just all of this SEO stuff, this guy is a fucking computer-illiterate dumbnut who fails to do anything with a computer other than responding to my e-mails. Another example - wanted to set up a [join.me](https://join.me) video conference call - that way it would be much easier communicating WHILE showing the material to him...literally in front of his screen with my voice. What gets better than that? Sent him the download link - and guess what. Guy had a difficult time downloading, didn't bother with instructions and just wanted to talk on the phone.

I thought I knew about SEO until subscribing to this subreddit. I have learned a lot from the posts and your experiences. I have worked as a front-end developer and I guess that created an illusion of ""oh yeah, I know about SEO"" in my mind. Anyway, this realization was good and I am really grateful to this cool community for sharing!

The reason that I am posting is to ask for your help. I will be working on a new project. It will be a non-English blog/journal with multiple authors. Competition in our niche is moderate considering the quantity of the contents out there. However, the quality of the contents is horrible, yet there are so many people reading/following these horrible contents. I believe the strongest part of this project will be the high-quality content that we will be publishing. Unfortunately, we will have no (very limited) budget but I believe doing the best we can will eventually pay off. This time I will be more on the editorial side and also be responsible for SEO. As I have mentioned, there will be multiple authors and I am planning to prepare them a documentation so that they can create the content with SEO in mind. I will do the final touches and also handle off-site optimization activities. We are going to use WordPress. Because of my past experience, I am aware of the importance of choosing the right theme and load speed of the pages and content. Regarding the WordPress SEO, I am only aware of YoastSEO plugin.

What is your SEO routine? (Long term and short term). I know obviously to meet the company goals. But what are some things that you do everyday to achieve those, and how much time do you spend doing each of these things.

This can range anywhere from planning to working. I am curious to see how other SEOs do their job so maybe I can implement things into my routine that I may not be doing. Thanks

Here is my daily routine

Daily Routine:

- Plug keywords into Rank Tracker by SEO Powersuite to see if there's any decline in traffic. I enter the data into my spreadsheet with conditional formatting which makes it easier to visualize drops in rankings

- Answer Haro Queries related that's related to the company's site in hopes to build links

- Analyze data in spreadsheets 

- Prospect for link building opportunities (outreach afterwards)

- Manually build citations (for this month)

- Repurpose content and share to different sites (via Social Media Manager)

- Research industry news to keep up on trends from industry experts.

- Assign topics to content team based on keyword intent &amp; volume

- Analyze data in Search Console 

- Converse with Project Manager, Marketing Director, and other SEO strategist to plan future strategies

- Daily meetings for progress up.

- Check for site wide issues, 404s, indexation problems, url structure. 

- Benchmark results in my benchmark spreadsheet.

The site is ranking just on page one (position 10) for it's main keyword and I have done a full link audit. This is where things get interesting. It is not a particularly competitive keyword at 1900 monthly searches (bear this in mind).

The clients link portfolio is make up solely of web 2.0s, directories and some blog comments (not created by me!!). Now if any of my other sites had spammy links I would simply disavow them as the rest of the link profile is sound enough. But here the client is ranking solely on spam and I am finding it hard to draw a line between deciding which spam I should disavow and which spam I should leave as mass disavowing would be suicidal in my humble oppinion.

Then I read this a post suggesting that disavowing does nothing anyway and I am thinking to just ignore the spam and begin building decent links.

I need to note, some links have a high spam score on Moz as one option I am thinking of is to disavow these ones that are highlighted as really spammy and leave the others are not being flagged as too spammy.

What's everyone's thoughts? At a loss here and don't want to do anything to hurt the site...

There is a connection between the 2, as he does sell the classes to customers that stay at the B&amp;B and take the local tours. In some cases he sells the class with accomodation included. So there is a big cross over with both business. Although the B&amp;B can be booked independently.

I've told him this is one business with multiple services, but he insists they are seperate and have a seperate website and should have seperate GMB listings, which he wants to set up himself. 

Apparantly, he has been on the phone with Google to get the business listed, and google want further proof the second business is at that location. On Google maps they can see the sign out front for the workshops.
The workshop site has a listing on GMB and shows for local searches, but the B&amp;B doesn't. 

Is there a way I can help him here? or should he just bite the bullet and accept that if Google thinks it's one listing at the address then it's one listing. 

The only other solution I could give him was to list the second address as 'apartment A' and see if Google buys it. But TBH I don't think it will fly. 

His two websites also promote each other. On the classes website there is a section for accomodation and tours, and on the B&amp;B website there is a section dedicated to classes.

There are a few distinct reasons for this, not least of which is that very few businesses are using blogging to its full potential. Most businesses ignore blogs, as they aren’t considered to be part of the “bread and butter” of digital marketing, but this is a critical error that can cost you dearly in terms of your search engine rankings. Most people see blogs as something casual, or dedicated to long-form writing. They’re particularly useful for SEO purposes because, when they’re well written, they provide content that is both informative and engaging to your consumers.

**Taking Advantage of Trends**

Recent trends in the digital marketing landscape have shifted away from the short sponsored posts that once dominated the market. Today’s search engines don’t opt as much for keyword saturation and egregious link building, but instead prioritize sites that feature long content. Users, too, are shifting their attention towards long content, and savoring the experience of reading a well-researched, easy-to-read piece of a few thousand words article. Take advantage of this trend by structuring a blog pertaining to your business according to the types of long content that perform well on search engine rankings.

**Tips and Tricks**

While you can do whatever you like with your blog, there are a few tips and trick that you might like to use so that you can maximize your business’s SEO potential. For example, you want to write blog posts that are informative without being too stuffy or formal in their language or form, as they’re aimed at a casual audience. When it comes to the tone of your blog, you want it to be consistent with your business’s branding so that it adequately conveys your mission and what you as a business stand for. Once you’ve created the content, you can get to work on keywords, link building, and integrating references to your local area. The blog must be a seamless part of your business’s website, too, so it’s easy to access and will help your search engine rankings.

[**How to Create a Great SEO Blog:**](http://dwellsolutions.in)

**Humanize Your Articles**

First of all, ensure that your blog authors include a byline with a bit of information about them. This will humanize your employees in the eyes of the readership, making your business seem more “real” to them and encouraging future engagement. Google treats blogs with author tags preferentially, and prioritizes them over blogs that don’t acknowledge authorship.

**Research**

Always do your research, both on your blog topic and which keyword combinations are going to improve your search engine rankings. Customizing and tailoring your titles, matching the URLs with the keywords, and using strategic mentions of your location are great ways to maximize your blog’s SEO potential. One element of great research is awareness of the media. When the media start to squawk about your industry, you want your business to be ready for the massive surge in searches and traffic that accompanies any and every media furor.

**Tags and Links to Related Posts**

You should definitely include tag pages and links to related posts. This is common practice across most of the world’s industries with a foot in the door of the digital marketplace. How many times have you been reading a blog when you saw an ad for a similar story at the foot of the page? This helps to enhance your topical keyword associations, and will assist your loyal readers in finding similar content on your site and through your blog.

**Post Regularly**

It’s critical that you post regularly as well. You wouldn’t buy your favorite paper (that is, if you still pay for a physical newspaper) if it weren’t published at regular intervals. The same goes for your blog. If you fail to post regularly – even if it’s only once a week – your customers will get bored of waiting for new content and find something else to read. As long as you produce new content for your blog at regular intervals, you’ll keep the traffic coming in and your search engine rankings won’t suffer in the process. People love stability when it comes to their chosen services, so give your audience what they crave and provide well-researched blog posts that your readers and customers can enjoy and look forward to every week.

So as the title suggests I specialize in getting big backlinks for clients... like domain authority 60 DA and up. The formula is actually extremely simple... you create a newsworthy item or something really cool content wise and then pitch it out to journalists that write about similar or relevant topics.

And what I mean by that is as follows: So I had an auto client that needed some big links. So I scanned the news headlines looking for something I could latch onto.

Well at that time, Trump was thinking about instituting that 25% auto tariff. And based on that, Toyota came out with a press release saying that tariff would increase the cost of the Camry by $1800.

Well after some digging, I found the formula they used to get that specific number, I then applied it to 10 other top selling cars in the US.

So now I have some really intriguing data than I can pitch to journalists about a newsworthy relevant topic.

I then find journalists who write about that subject, and shoot them a very quick and simple email with the data (and tell them my client created it, not me, so my client gets credit).

After about 50 to 100 emails, the data got picked up, articles were written (by the journalists, not me), and my client got some really nice top-tier links, for example from CBS News, The Daily Caller and more.

Another time, I made a retro Tesla Starman video game that got picked up all over the place.. Mashable, CNET, etc.

Basically the formula is extremely simple... make something awesome, or newsworthy, and then pitch it out there.

This kind of link building is getting tougher, but it still works with the right type of content.

The only fall back is it's a bit like fishing... many times you create content that never gets picked up. So you essentially go to the lake, cast your line, and don't catch any ""fish."" That is frustrating, but it is what it is.

Using this method I've gotten in most of the top sites, with the exception of the New York Times and sites like The Wall Street Journal, that hardly ever use outside content.

Again, the concept isn't hard to grasp, you just have to come up with the right content and be creative.

With that said, I'm kind of looking to expand a bit, maybe team up with some people. Reason being is that frustrating part about creating content and not getting anything out of it. There is nothing worse than spending 3 days on something, and getting absolutely nothing out of it... so I'm looking for other ways to offer the service, maybe create a different kind of package to offer, where I get compensated for all the content I'm created, instead of just the content that generates links.

Anyway, just throwing feelers out there! Cheers!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well at that time, Trump was thinking about instituting that 25% auto tariff. And based on that, Toyota came out with a press release saying that tariff would increase the cost of the Camry by $1800.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well after some digging, I found the formula they used to get that specific number, I then applied it to 10 other top selling cars in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I have some really intriguing data than I can pitch to journalists about a newsworthy relevant topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then find journalists who write about that subject, and shoot them a very quick and simple email with the data (and tell them my client created it, not me, so my client gets credit).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After about 50 to 100 emails, the data got picked up, articles were written (by the journalists, not me), and my client got some really nice top-tier links, for example from CBS News, The Daily Caller and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another time, I made a retro Tesla Starman video game that got picked up all over the place.. Mashable, CNET, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically the formula is extremely simple... make something awesome, or newsworthy, and then pitch it out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of link building is getting tougher, but it still works with the right type of content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only fall back is it&amp;#39;s a bit like fishing... many times you create content that never gets picked up. So you essentially go to the lake, cast your line, and don&amp;#39;t catch any &amp;quot;fish.&amp;quot; That is frustrating, but it is what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this method I&amp;#39;ve gotten in most of the top sites, with the exception of the New York Times and sites like The Wall Street Journal, that hardly ever use outside content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the concept isn&amp;#39;t hard to grasp, you just have to come up with the right content and be creative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that said, I&amp;#39;m kind of looking to expand a bit, maybe team up with some people. Reason being is that frustrating part about creating content and not getting anything out of it. There is nothing worse than spending 3 days on something, and getting absolutely nothing out of it... so I&amp;#39;m looking for other ways to offer the service, maybe create a different kind of package to offer, where I get compensated for all the content I&amp;#39;m created, instead of just the content that generates links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, just throwing feelers out there! Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

My question is, should I be doing internal links from that Cornerstone content to those individual articles that explains how unlock the bootloader, how to install a custom recovery, etc.

I just need unbiased feedback in an area that is outside my expertise. 

I'm a business strategy consultant, not a digital marketer (so please forgive my lack of detailed technical understanding... Please ELI5). 

I have a client who is a local business owner (trades). He's been paying $500/mo for SEO on 3-5 search terms for over a year. Don't get me wrong, his business ranks number one for those terms, so a lot of things were obviously done right.

He doesn't do content marketing of any sort, so the website hasn't really changed. The website has 32 backlinks from 16 domains, almost all of them business directories. If it's relevant, he posts OC to Facebook about once per week. No advertising at all. However, he has over 100 5* Google reviews (they're a really awesome local business who have a great service and do it well). 

My client had a falling out with his SEO guy and would like me to find him a new one for the same rate. That's easy enough for me to do, but from my very basic understanding of SEO, I'm not sure what they'd do unless we start creating new website content? 

I have 5 interrelated questions (so I can advise how to proceed and justify myself one way or the other):

1. Was my client getting scammed paying $500/mo for over a year without new content or backlinks outside directories? What am I missing? 

2. What investment level (hours, not $) is required each month to maintain his organic results?

3. If we go the content route, what is the minimum post length and frequency to get good results (or is it beneficial at all)? 

4. How important is regular social posting for SEO, specifically?

5. Do you know of any non-technical resources for local business about what needs to be done, why, for how long, what results to expect, and how much to pay?

He wants a local SEO campaign on top but I’m being nice saying unless the site is fixed or rebuilt I’m not taking his money for a local SEO campaign because it won’t have its full effect which would lead to a waste of money and me looking bad. 

I should just take the money, not do it and tell him I’ve done it. So sick of people telling me how to do my job lmao.

I've been runing my own campaign for the snack pack for almost 2 years now and yet my competitors are ranking way higher than me.   
Here's what I've done for the snack pack

\- Website was number 1 for almost EVERYTHING before the update, services, location pages, blog posts etc

\- Had the title tags, metadata very well specified to my niche and target city

\- Address on the website is the same as Google My Business's hence the correct NAP data

\- Have made HUNDREDS of citations with the correct NAP, whereas my competitors have been ranking above me with just a few citations. Again I'm emphasizing on NAP because that's what most SEO experts tell me that i have it wrong but I've doubled and tripled checked it. (Even made citations from the websites where my competitors had their location set)

\- Implemented Schema Markup on the website. I have that on for 2 years now. 

\- Obtained dofollow and nofollow links from magazines, blogs via guest posting for the website

**Coming to Google My Business**

\- Using a local telephone number

\- Categories are highly accurate

\- I have geotagged and titled the pictures as keywords

\- Keeping it up to date by posts and pictures

\- I have excellent reviews and that to from REAL people. 

\- Changed my competitors category from one thing to another however, his google maps rankings are still higher. (Just a small test that I had to do- No change in his rankings. Don't judge me) 

\- NAP is consistent everywhere

I don't think I've missed anyting. It's like Google doesn't want me to rank or something. Your help will be much appreciated, been struggling with this for almost 2 years now. And no I'm not kidding.

I work for a reputable online ecommerce site. Recently someone reached out and offered to lease us his domain, with the idea being he'd 301 all pages on his site to ours. We would collect the massive amount of traffic, around 1m yearly visits, and hopefully convert many into subscribers/customers. 

Let's assume for example his site is [tires.com](https://tires.com) and we own [yourdailytire.com](https://yourdailytire.com) selling just one tire per day. We don't have a large sitemap with many products. Just one. So we couldn't reasonably 301 his site pages to an equally relevant page on our site - everything to the homepage.

I'm inclined to think Google would drop a lot of the rankings for his search terms and we probably wouldn't get nearly the same amount of traffic. 

The price is actually fair, if we assume that the 1m or so visits actually convert into subscribers/customers at a similar rate as our normal visitors do.

* How do you implement Schema.org?
* How to test your Schema.org implementation
* What search engines support Schema.org
* Whether structured data leads to higher rankings (this will surprise you)
* Best practices from renowned SEO experts

Over the years I've been getting more into SEO/IM than development since I've been working with clients that have online stores. I like everything that revolves around sales, email marketing, advertising, customer retention etc.   


I'm relocating to Czech Republic in the following few months and would like to increase my income, and even work harder to reach some of my short and long term goals. Since I have a strong development background, I'd like to get in some new clients and offer something that not a lot of SEO guys offer as a sole service - technical SEO. I've been working a lot lately with fixing broken links, monitoring crawled pages, improving website speed, Google Tag Manager, caching, minification, CDN etc. I would say that I can definitely **ONLY** improve a client's technical SEO if I am hired. Considering that, I would like to ask you guys the following:  


1. **What do you consider as technical SEO**
2. **What would you expect to be delivered by a freelancer that offers to improve your technical SEO**
3. **Do you think that a lot of usual clients would buy an EXCLUSIVELY technical SEO gig without the link building etc.**

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://Website1.com""&gt;Website1.com&lt;/a&gt; – main website, main KW “San Fransisco Tours ” + targets KWs of other sites &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://Website2.com""&gt;Website2.com&lt;/a&gt; – main KW “Golden Gate Bridge Tours”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://Website3.com""&gt;Website3.com&lt;/a&gt; - main KW “Golden Gate Bridge Segway Rentals”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://Website4.com""&gt;Website4.com&lt;/a&gt; - main KW “San Fransico Segway Rentals”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://Website5.com""&gt;Website5.com&lt;/a&gt; - main KW “Alcatraz Island Tours”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we are chanding to platform that have multistore set-up possibility. On the plus side multi store will make administration/maintenance much easier. But I am afraid it can effect SEO so wonder if we should keep it single store set-up / separate IPs.&lt;/p&gt;

I work as a marketing intern for an urbanwear clothing store in a small city. I have been given the task of writing a job description for an SEO person. My boss and myself don't really know what we are looking for, but I said I'd compare a few different job descriptions and see what I can come up with.  Currently, we are in the beginning Ecommerce stage and I think we mostly just need more website traffic.

The job description rough draft is as follows:

&gt;*X Company, a streetwear and lifestyle brand retailer, is looking to hire for a Search Engine Optimization (SEO) specialist to help in the growth of our E-commerce website.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Key Responsibilities:*  
&gt;  
&gt;*•	Discuss and contribute to X Company's organic search strategy to develop more traffic to the website; including an inbound link strategy.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*•	Assist in search optimized content generation.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*•	Use analytics tools (Google Analytics, Google Trends, SEMRush, Moz, Ahrefs, ect.) to analyze and capitalize on SEO development.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*•	Audit website, and ensure continuous improvement to website traffic and conversion.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Requirements:*  
&gt;  
&gt;*•	Passion for SEO and internet marketing.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*•	Understand technological aspects related to SEO (URL structure, etc.).*  
&gt;  
&gt;*•	Solid understanding of performance marketing, conversion, and online customer acquisition.*

Am I totally off? What do you think I should add? What would be good to ask for as experience requirements?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;X Company, a streetwear and lifestyle brand retailer, is looking to hire for a Search Engine Optimization (SEO) specialist to help in the growth of our E-commerce website.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key Responsibilities:&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;•   Discuss and contribute to X Company&amp;#39;s organic search strategy to develop more traffic to the website; including an inbound link strategy.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;•   Assist in search optimized content generation.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;•   Use analytics tools (Google Analytics, Google Trends, SEMRush, Moz, Ahrefs, ect.) to analyze and capitalize on SEO development.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;•   Audit website, and ensure continuous improvement to website traffic and conversion.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Requirements:&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;•   Passion for SEO and internet marketing.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;•   Understand technological aspects related to SEO (URL structure, etc.).&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;•   Solid understanding of performance marketing, conversion, and online customer acquisition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I totally off? What do you think I should add? What would be good to ask for as experience requirements?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a good chance we would be working with this person on an &amp;#39;as needed&amp;#39; basis. We found that some people we have hired online don&amp;#39;t really know what they are doing. I am trying to be realistic, but still be able to hire someone who adds value.&lt;/p&gt;

I'd like to know what's the impact of having the same page content in english (/en/page) and spanish (/es/page). 95% of the content is the same (can't be translated), I just want to translate menu and section titles.

Another thing worth to mention, I do not use Apache/Nginx webservers and all my content is static (S3 based), which means If I have to achieve the same thing today (which I am), I'm doing it through some javascript (check for url parameters, hide/display div based on language). But this .js hack is definitely not the best for multiple reasons (e.g: because I work at DOM level, my two menus are shortly displayed when you arrive on the page etc)

So back to my point, what's the SEO impact of having 2 pages, same content, but just minor menu translation?

6 years in SEO, last 2 have been managing a team of 2 specialists, and recently a LOT more. Position has quickly changed from just managing our campaigns to what I feel is Director level work. Current salary is 70k.

Small(ish) agency, high cost of living state but NOT in a major city. My current title is Manager but I'm running our entire SEO department (...of 3 people atm) now. Agency is a total of 11 people including owners, however with our growth rate right now we're going to be adding people very soon.

Agency recently came under new ownership/management. New management didn't know anything about SEO before meeting me, and are now extremely excited to be able to sell it. They had a previous client base that they brought in and will be selling new big SEO deals to. Also now selling to a much broader &amp; more lucrative market than we used to sell to.

I'm the only one here who can develop strategy for clients and the agency itself, price out SEO work, ensure the work is completed correctly, and speak to technical SEO details to clients. I have quickly gone from speaking with owners of SMBs to speaking &amp; pitching to C-level execs multimillion (some billion) megacorps. It's been scary, awesome, and confidence-boosting all at once to be able to be part of closing those kinds of deals.

I feel like the level of work I'm doing in this new environment is WAY, WAY above the normal tasks of an SEO Manager.

Should also note that new management loves me right now. I haven't broached salary yet but have been told multiple times how I am opening up huge potential revenue opportunities for us. I also have very specific knowledge of our target industries that any new person coming in would have to really truly understand in order to succeed. Mostly just gained from years of working with very specific clients.

I'm struggling with how much to ask for. I know someone in a Director role in NYC could probably get 125k, but we're not quite at that level. However, I kind of feel like even that would be a bit low for what I'm doing and the value I'm providing the company now. Just feels a little crazy to ask for a jump that high. I may propose a title bump to Director of Inbound Marketing or something and take over PPC &amp; email too.

In addition to a salary boost, how strange would it be to request like 3% of revenue that comes in directly for SEO?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Am I crazy for valuing myself so highly in this situation?&lt;/p&gt;

I'm doing the SEO of a WordPress E-commence website. When I was doing the SEO audit, found 2600+URLs rare indexed in the Google Webmaster whereas this website only has 69 pages to Index.

I have a question regarding Email marketing and SEO.

Our goal is to have as many subscribers to our multiple and different E-mail newsletters, as possible, so we want to make it even easier to signup from our newsletter form. I was thinking about prefilling the ""e-mail"" and ""name"" section of the user and this way make it easier for them to just hit ""send"", thus growing our subscription rate.

This data is only going to be taken if the user has already signed up for other newsletter on our site (as I said we have multiple newsletters).

My questions are:

* would there be any GDPR problems regarding this, since we are going to take data that the user once provided but we are just going to show it to them when he goes to another page of our website;
* are there any SEO dangers - is the data more vulnerable this way and are we going to be attacked by email harvesters;
* are there any good practices regarding this case.

Thanks in advance to everyone who answers. I think it's an interesting case for a discussion :)

There is a page called `/before-and-after/`, which is an overview of all the before-and-after pages (there are maybe 15), containing links to all of these pages with short descriptions.

The more specific pages are structured like `/before-and-after/houses/`, `/before-and-after/apartments/`, etc. The `/before-and-after/` general page contains links to these sub pages.

I would think that, if `/before-and-after/` contained all the content for these specific pages that could be dynamically loaded in to the page (for instance, clicking on Houses would dynamically load in Houses content rather than loading the page `/before-and-after/houses/`), it would make  before-and-after a more useful page with a longer visit time, and could help its ranking.

I could also somehow canonicalize the more specific pages like `/before-and-after/houses/` so that they would not be hurt by the duplicate content. Or maybe I wouldn't even need more specific pages at that point.

There are some reasons for you why you need SEO in your online resource: 

1) Organic search is usually a primary source of website traffic. People believe that GOOGLE knows everything. That\`s why they so often start their purchases from this channel. Being highly visible as a trusted resource in the search engines always works in a brand’s favor. 

2) Smart SEO helps your website get more trust and credibility. A website with beautiful and clear user experience, a website that can be easily found by search engines is usually more noticeable among thousands of its competitors. SEO is something that will help you achieve such results. 

3) Local SEO, with the growth of mobile traffic, helps you raise engagement, traffic and conversions. It aims at optimizing your digital properties for a specific vicinity, so people can find you quickly and easily, which makes them one step closer to a transaction. 

4) SEO is relatively cheap. Of course, not all things can be done for free. But, for sure, the payoff will most likely be considered in terms of a brand’s benefit and bottom line. 

5) SEO is a long-term strategy. This instrument can\`t be used for 2 or 3 months and be expected to get great results. If you choose SEO - be ready to work with it systematically - and achieve your strategic goals.

I am running a project which aims to completely redesign our small/medium Business-to-Business webpages hailing from 1990-2000's. One of the many goals is to optimize and make content readable for web-crawlers, sharpen up the URL-structure and create content for visitor personas.

We offer few different services for clients, lets call them ""Service A"", ""Service B"" and ""Service C"". I am wondering how should I shape up the structure, URL's and content of these areas so web-crawlers would be happy. My gut-feeling in pushing me to create separate pages for each service and ensure that pages are optimized for that service specific keyword. URL-structure and navigation level example below:

1. Home
2. /services
3. //service-A  
//service-B  
//service-C

This however, leaves me with dilemma of having to have a 'Service landing page' and visitors are forced to click through it before landing on any of the specific service pages. Not sure is this the best visitor experience or best practice.

One solution I have been thinking is to collect everything in one 'services' page and use some (quite nice) ways to present content using e.g. accordion/click-to-expand articles or tabs where content is on same page, but hidden before user clicks to expand the info. But this however, most probably dilutes SEO juice as -think that- I cannot assign too many H1 and different keywords in single URL-page. 

Should I go with the gut feeling, or would you have some different feedback or guidance to provide? Any feedback regarding this is most welcome.

Best regards,

I'm trying to develop some marketable hard skills and SEO seems to be one of them. These are the steps I think I ""should"" , please let me know what you think or if I'm missing anything. 

1. Create a website on Wordpress (a blog of something I care about enough to write some content and stay engaged. Like wellness, or health technology or mushroom cultivation) 
2. Once I have the website, open a google analytics account and start looking at some data.
3. Use MOZ, Lynda and Udemy for education and use my blog as my guinea pig. 
4. Use SEMrush to start learning keyword search
5. Start learning about PPC, Adwords, Facebook/Instagram Ads.

That's why today I made a quick guide on how I started finding QUALIFIED prospects to pitch my local SEO services. You can find that here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G64IUaYUCo


I use SEMrush to accomplish what I need to in the video, but Ahrefs has tools that could accomplish the same thing. Not everyone has access to these tools, so I've provided a 7 day trial via the affiliate program. I don't make anything from you starting a trial, and 7 days will be plenty to accomplish what's in the video!

Thankfully, my local is still atop the pile. I realize that it's aimed at health, fitness, and wellness sites, and that those who either sell products (I don't) that may be deemed suspicious, such as supplements, etc, are penalized. Others who may engage in riskier practices can be penalized without a certain level of backlinks, reviews, or other proofs of trust. As a personal trainer of over 20 years, I work on a myriad of complex issues such as ankylosing spondylitis, rehab for all joint issues, geriatric, etc, etc, etc. I train doctors, pro athletes, etc. Yes, I realize I break free of the stereotype of the job due to the complexity of my services, but is that alone enough reason to fall to the bottom of P4? Any ideas on how to bob back up to the surface over the next few months? With New Years coming in a few months, I'd like to regain my foothold on P1 or 2.

I'm not the expert that a lot of others are, but I have been doing this for a while with broad experience across verticals for small and large sites. 

I'm trying to figure out how to fix this issue. I'm doing it for a friend and as you know no good deed goes unpunished. 

The question is: what should I try or look for to fix this?

Details:

Company name is the keyword target. Basically the company name would be similar in structure like a hypothetical example of ""Chicago Orthopedics"" 

The domain is the company name. It has existed for 10 years. 

Call to action link above in slider goes to the contact page. 

Home page has unique intro text about 400 char that works well in the design. It mentions the company name twice and the location 1 additional time. H1 is primary keyword.

Other text on the home page include navigation at the top to:  
\- services, about, contact &amp; link to sister site

\- list of services in grid, with link from each service to the service page. Some use the natural variation of the keyword without the location since it is relevant, others don't. ex: Physical Therapy or whatever. Nothing looks spammy and they link to 1 services page which lists the services so there isn't a bunch of thin ""Chicago X"" type of pages. Just 1 page that lists the services. 

About page has more text naturally. About 1800 char. H1 is ""About Us"" H2 is ""Meet Our Team"" and another H2 with no keywords. It basically mentions the company name (that keyword, linked to the home page which I added recently to try and steer some relevance to the primary page) in some intro text and has bios for the company's employees. It mentions the service version of the keyword without location (Ex: Orthopedics) in some of the bios.

Meta descriptions are appropriate, not keyword stuffed, etc. 

I have tried a bunch of stuff to get the home page to rank instead of the about page, including: 

1. Changed the about page URL &amp; content, 301 old one to home page.
2. Added (currently there) Canonical tag on about page pointing to homepage
3. Added (currently there) link from the about page to the home page with the keyword term which is also the company name.  

Nothing seemed to make any difference. The new about page URL outranks the home page. 

There are no manual actions, the site is indexed fine, and a keyword search with site operator shows the home page first. (ex: chicago orthopedics site:chicagoorthopedics.com and orthopedics site:chicagoorthopedics.com)   
I can't find any toxic links to it. There's 1 blog where it's a blogroll link but I don't think it's a bad site. SEMrush toxic score is 38 (just one measure I know) and other sites have shown a nice boost from a link on this same blogroll. 

I mentioned a sister site. This is using the exact same design code &amp; architecture with different content. The only real difference is that it has 1 person on the about page so it is more of a personal service provider site. It is another service the owner provides. Let's say that is ""Chicago Physical Therapy"" and has a similar domain as above, chicagophysicaltherapy.com which it does. 

The sister site, which is virtually similar ranks just as desired with the home page for the single targeted term. They're cross linked from between the sites using just the service name in navigation, not location. ex: ""Physical Therapy"" from the Orthopedics site links here and ""Orthopedics"" from the PT site links to the other one. This sister site domain is 2 years old. 

Both sites have approx the same ratio of links to home page vs about or any other sub pages, and the same ratio of keyword to non-keyword terms in links. 

So, what should I try next?

So, I've had this blog on Google Blogger for quite some time now. Let's call it example.blogspot.com. It's indexed on Google Search, added to my Search Console account along with blogger perks like HTTPS and stuff.

Today, I bought a custom domain, say example.com, directly from Blogger's 'set up a custom domain' option using Google Domains.

The transition went fine, HTTPS was enabled, so was DNSSEC and now 

example.com redirect to https://www.example.com

www.example.com redirects to https://www.example.com

example.blogspot.com redirects to https://www.example.com


**I added the 'https://www.example.com' property to Search Console. Also, there was an option of 'change of address' when I opened 'example.blogspot.com' property in Search console which had the following options**

1. pick your new site from the list - already selected www.example.com

2. confirm that 301 redirects work properly - already confirmed

3. check that verification methods are still present - the website www.example.com was verified to my account using Google Domains so I 'Confirmed' this one.

4. Submit the change of address request - Submitted.


**Now, here are some of my question.**

1. Will I run into any trouble for duplicate content? All my redirects are working and the default site is 'www.example.com' permanently.
2. Do I have to set up a canonical URL? If yes, how do I do it? 
3. Do I have to request removal of the links already submitted to the Search Index (using Fetch as Google tool) or will it automatically update due to the 'Change of Address' submission.
4. If I have to submit new links from my blog to the Index, I should use the 'www.example.com' property instead of 'example.blogspot.com'. Right?

Hi everyone,

​

​

A group of us have recently launched a unique subReddit and we'd like to connect with you guys as the SEO experts. Why? Well, because our sub is dedicated to a single project - **combining Reddit's vast array of talents &amp; backgrounds to build a 1 business at a time**.

​

* Together as Redditors.
* From scratch: crowdsourcing the idea...
* ...to market execution (financially backed with $100k)

​

​

Businesses start with an idea and then get talent. We're doing the opposite - looking for talent first. Then, we'll crowdsource business ideas, have a voting process, analyze its viability, delegate roles/responsibilities/titles as necessary, and of course...take it to **full market execution**.

​

We've talked to some prominent advisors and consultants, and we're pretty optimistic on what may become of this.

​

So we'd love if we could have some of you guys join us to help us mold what our community will become.

​

​

​

Our sub is /TheBusinessGroup: [https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBusinessGroup/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBusinessGroup/)

​

​

We hope to see some of you there :)

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit: [The concept of this message, but not necessarily its contents, has been approved by the moderators at /SEO].&lt;/p&gt;

I recently got a website to do SEO for, which was previously handled by someone else and I'm stuck at this problem. I tried searching for answers everywhere and got nowhere, so I'm hoping someone can help. Here's the problem:

Titles of all its pages in search results have something extra attached to them, so it looks something like this: ""Webpage title - long mysterious phrase"". The prase is the same on all websites and it seems like it's set to appear automatically.

I went through Yoast plugin and can't identify where this is supposed to be. It's also not manually written in the SEO title section. It's very annoying because it's messing up the titles and looks weird in Google Analytics.

Does someone know how to get rid of this? I'm desperate.

&lt;p&gt;By the way, I&amp;#39;ve been lurking on reddit for about two years and this is my first ever post!&lt;/p&gt;

While i'd find it absolutely OK to put a (single) backlink to their own site on the sites of their client, i find these links a bit shady. To me this looks, that the SEO agency is using their client's site to boost their own ranking with the linked keywords. Furthermore this smells a lot like ranking-manipulation to me - and probably also Google. Might this even result in Google penalizing my friend's website?

1. Outreach via their contact form/email.
2. Few hacky ways like infographic submission or scholarship link building (which seems to be totally useless now)
3. Finding brokers and dealing with them for guest post links in bulk

And here are few things why it sucked always:

* These brokers deliver really shitty links and it becomes difficult few times to remove such links.
* Negotiation time is too much. Discovering new blogs is such a pain in the ass.

So I've built a product (thanks to WordPress API's) which allows anyone to post any article on WordPress enabled blog in few seconds. All you have to do is:

1. Go on [https://pressly.me](https://pressly.me)
2. Signup and compose your first guest post (You can add links, medias and whatever you want)
3. Select blogs where you want to publish this piece of content
4. Pay and hit ""Publish"" and your guest post is live instantly.

Here is how it works in the backend:

* Bloggers who want to monetize their blogs are partnered with Pressly and they have setup a fixed cost for guest post.
* Since they have enabled their Wp APIs and created user for Pressly, getting post published takes literally 3 second.

It's just the first week of this product and I have managed to partner with 50+ websites (mostly they are in tech/crypto niche) but its growing like crazy.

Do check out Pressly and share your experience of doing guest/sponsored post submission with them. I'm 200% sure that you'll be surprised after using this product for guest posting.

PS: If you are a blogger, you can get partnered with Pressly.me by contacting them on prateek@pressly.me

I have taken a lot of photos for local businesses here in NYC and New Jersey. My standard practice is to just pass images over to them so they can choose how they want to 'represent' themselves via photography.

1. Should I be uploading the images myself to their business page and taging myself?

It needs to be updated as well, so I'm curious about how important that link is, especially if we take it down and redo it.

2. What is the best approach to expressing to clients that I shoot in NYC all the time without painting it in big bold letters in my business name like, Darren Phillip Jones Photography, Yes... YES I shoot in NYC. Please don't ignore me because my address says NJ. My friend rents in Hell's Kitchen, and said I could use his address, but I don't know how reliable that is since he just rents there.

3. Does it help to photograph local attractions and tag my business? I'm trying to figure out how to increase my rankings outside of hoping a big agency picks me up and remembers to tag my site. That's actually a big issue for me as well. I have been published in some crazy big magazines, high traffic sites... but article writers always 'forget' to credit me and back link to my site. And I am lucky if I find one of my photos used without tagging. Tracking all of my images would be a nightmare.

4. Do any of you know of a decent service that tracks photos that doesn't cost a fortune? And a good practice with it? I know of 1-2 services, but they are pricey, and not reliable. Especially since people resize everything, it doesn't always catch. I even found one of my photos in the wild, and exported to the same size, and it still didn't catch it.

I did google 'Photographer SEO' to see what comes up, but a lot of it was super basic info, like making sure to blog and tag photos! And include photographer in your keywords!

If you have any tips or advice, I'm all ears! And if you're in the NYC area and would like to possibly trade services, let me know. I don't have a lot of disposable cash, but I'd love to help you, whoever you are, out in return. Maybe I'll talk to the admins about doing a silly headshot day or something for you guys.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without trying to ask super generic questions, I wanted to know if anyone was knowledgeable on SEO when it comes to photography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have taken a lot of photos for local businesses here in NYC and New Jersey. My standard practice is to just pass images over to them so they can choose how they want to &amp;#39;represent&amp;#39; themselves via photography.&lt;/p&gt;

This is quite a mess, a confusing tale I tell.

In mid to late July, I changed the url of a page to something very similar (for SEO purposes) and set up a 301 redirect from the previous URL to the new one. 

Within the last couple of weeks, I noticed that the page has completely fallen out of the rankings altogether. When I Google searched for the new URL, the top listing was the old URL, but the exact new URL is not to be found. The page was last indexed early July, before I changed the URL.

I looked in my .htaccess and remembered that at some point in the past I had used the new URL for an old version of the site, and that redirect was still in my .htaccess file. So, I had a looping problem: URL A redirects to URL B redirects to URL A. I quickly deleted the original redirect, leaving only URL B redirecting to URL A.

I then used Google Search Console's Index Coverage tool and discovered that the new URL is Excluded, type: ""Page with Redirect"". I inspected that page using the same tool and discovered that the User-directed canonical and the google-declared canonical are the same, the old URL.

Is this purely a redirect issue that will resolve if I request a new crawl from Google? If so, is there a drawback to doing that?

Or have my mistakes caused a huge canonical mess? If so, how do i resolve it?

Thanks very much!

I have an on page SEO question that’s been bugging me and I do hope you’ll be able to help.

&amp;#x200B;

I have an ecommerce site that sells to USA/Thailand

&amp;#x200B;

My question would be on the page structure that I would use to target these countries. Now Country TLD is not possible in my case (.uk,.vn,.th) and I am going with subfolders and I feel it helps just a little bit more than a sub domain.

​

The main business will Be targeting in the USA, with a single payment processor for all regions

​

So here is what I cannot decide on the URL structure

&amp;#x200B;

Option 1.

&amp;#x200B;

Have a landing page targeting the different countries other than USA.

eg. [abc.com/buy-item-thailand](https://abc.com/buy-item-thailand)

​

examples :

[https://www.exabytes.com/philippines-web-hosting](https://www.exabytes.com/philippines-web-hosting)

[https://www.uavsystemsinternational.com/drones-sale-thailand-buying-drones-thailand/](https://www.uavsystemsinternational.com/drones-sale-thailand-buying-drones-thailand/)

&amp;#x200B;

I will build links to these landing pages for thai rankings as I will be using the same payment processor for all countries

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Option 2

&amp;#x200B;

URL : Abc.com/th/buy-product

&amp;#x200B;

This option will be an entire separate site focused to the thai region

One benefit i think of this, is that I can have a separate blog just creating thai specific content while my main site abc.com creates US content. I would also be able to get country specific sitelinks to appear in the SERP as opposed to a landing page as well as create lots more of country specific content

​

examples :  [https://www.adidas.com/us/men-shoes](https://www.adidas.com/us/men-shoes)

​

Option 3

Abc.com/th/en-th

This is even more language and country specific but I am wondering if there are too many layers diluting my content as the product page will look something like

[Abc.com/th/en-th/buy-product](https://Abc.com/th/en-th/buy-product)

​

example :

[https://www.nike.com/th/en\_th/](https://www.nike.com/sg/en_gb/)

I'm trying my best to recover it now using different techniques and strategies and while it would be nice to do it one at a time, there's so much to do. One instance I was always #1 for certain keywords, I was proud really! But I changed the entire site's architecture and I thought 301 would pass the SERP over but I was wrong, way wrong. It's been about 8 months since I did this, is it still recoverable if I changed the URLs back to what it was? I didn't know Google cared how far away something was from the HP but yet, another mistake. Now google has thousands of 404 pages, yet they all 301 just fine on my end. Is there hope? Webmatser tools only show less than 50 query pages in the past month and before it was tens of thousands at least. Good lord, what have I done?

​

**EDIT 1:** This thread got very large, all over the place etc... It turned out that my fatal mistake was not including canonical tags along with other minor issues which can all be resolved. RIP this will take some doing. Thank you for the help!

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT 2:** I ended up doing the canonical thing and instead of using 301 redirects for everything, i permitted the page to exist with canonical to the new page. Thankfully I'm pretty nifty with PHP so it didn't take much effort. Now Google understands how the site is structured and while not all links have returned into the top 10 listings, many have already been resolved. It's only a matter of time.  Within a few hours one of the pages that I was aiming to get listed got #5 spot. It's not #1 as it once was but it's better than being unlisted. Now I'm focusing on other SEO related techniques to boost my pages but the hard part is over.

I&amp;#39;m trying my best to recover it now using different techniques and strategies and while it would be nice to do it one at a time, there&amp;#39;s so much to do. One instance I was always #1 for certain keywords, I was proud really! But I changed the entire site&amp;#39;s architecture and I thought 301 would pass the SERP over but I was wrong, way wrong. It&amp;#39;s been about 8 months since I did this, is it still recoverable if I changed the URLs back to what it was? I didn&amp;#39;t know Google cared how far away something was from the HP but yet, another mistake. Now google has thousands of 404 pages, yet they all 301 just fine on my end. Is there hope? Webmatser tools only show less than 50 query pages in the past month and before it was tens of thousands at least. Good lord, what have I done?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT 1:&lt;/strong&gt; This thread got very large, all over the place etc... It turned out that my fatal mistake was not including canonical tags along with other minor issues which can all be resolved. RIP this will take some doing. Thank you for the help!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT 2:&lt;/strong&gt; I ended up doing the canonical thing and instead of using 301 redirects for everything, i permitted the page to exist with canonical to the new page. Thankfully I&amp;#39;m pretty nifty with PHP so it didn&amp;#39;t take much effort. Now Google understands how the site is structured and while not all links have returned into the top 10 listings, many have already been resolved. It&amp;#39;s only a matter of time.  Within a few hours one of the pages that I was aiming to get listed got #5 spot. It&amp;#39;s not #1 as it once was but it&amp;#39;s better than being unlisted. Now I&amp;#39;m focusing on other SEO related techniques to boost my pages but the hard part is over. Big thanks to all your help!&lt;/p&gt;

Looking for some suggestions on how can a solopreneur scale SEO like authority sites do?

Some concrete examples:

Guest posting: Scored some great links but diminishing return after a few articles. Focus on gaining referral domains instead but constant outreach (for new sites) takes too much time, more than writing the article itself. Also taking time away from writing for my own site.

Media outreach: Also very time consuming, success rate being low and sometimes you don't get link, or a no-follow.

Citations: Quality ones already done, ranking in 3-pack for those searching in my area. Don't need hundreds and certainly don't want spammy citations.

PBNs: Nearly all competitors in my niche are relying on PBNs more or less, mixed results. It's like a drug, the juice feels great at the beginning then you keep adding until you die from overdose. Having too many homepage PBN links is a dangerous footprint anyway?

Yes SEO works but everything I have done so far feels like a linear (time consuming) approach.

&lt;p&gt;Guest posting: Scored some great links but diminishing return after a few articles. Focus on gaining referral domains instead but constant outreach (for new sites) takes too much time, more than writing the article itself. Also taking time away from writing for my own site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Media outreach: Also very time consuming, success rate being low and sometimes you don&amp;#39;t get link, or a no-follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citations: Quality ones already done, ranking in 3-pack for those searching in my area. Don&amp;#39;t need hundreds and certainly don&amp;#39;t want spammy citations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PBNs: Nearly all competitors in my niche are relying on PBNs more or less, mixed results. It&amp;#39;s like a drug, the juice feels great at the beginning then you keep adding until you die from overdose. Having too many homepage PBN links is a dangerous footprint anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR
Yes SEO works but everything I have done so far feels like a linear (time consuming) approach. Interested in hearing ideas on how you can go exponential, leap frogging competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

So, the question: we're a recruitment business located just outside London, but 95% of our clients are in London. How do we go about informing GMB and optimising accordingly (in addition to blog posts etc.)?

&amp;#x200B;

Additional info:

&amp;#x200B;

I've owned a recruitment business for 20 years and we've never really focussed too much on our own SEO. Mainly because the places we advertise (job boards) and our competitors have much deeper pockets and resources to invest in SEO. However, as we're about to rebrand it would make sense to at least make the logical steps. FYI this will effectively be a brand new business (from Google's perspective, and this can't change).

They were pretty good questions. I thought you’d find them helpful if you’re preparing for an interview or are looking for a new/similar gig. It's an SEO-driven editorial job. I was in a hiring role years ago, and wish I had asked some of these.

1. Why are you interested in this position? How does your previous experience relate to this position?

2. What can you tell me about your writing process and how do you deal with writing for an audience you are not well acquainted with?

3. What makes good writing? How do you know if a piece of content is performing well?

4. Can you give us one example of how you pulled a story idea back from what you felt was certain failure?

5. When you receive a document to edit, how do you approach the process? What are you strengths and weaknesses as an editor?

6. How do you balance independent thinking and cooperation with others? Share an example.

7. What is your experience with content strategy and SEO? How have you used these to increase the reach and impact of your content?

8. What is this first thing you do to optimize your work for search?

9. What have you found to be the best way to confer with writers and editors concerning approaches needed to increase the SEO and engagement value of content?

I will try to keep on track as not to bore you. I will also try to keep companies, products and SEO companies vague as to not go against the rules.

* I have created a website for a family business. We are busy at our physical location, but wanted to try an online store. Our top selling product is X (not sure on the rules about listing products/websites)
* I've been using Neil Patel's SEO autochecker, scoring an 89. I can get this over 90 with some tweaking I'm sure.
* When compared to the top 3 websites on google selling product X, I out rank them anywhere from 3-20+ points. 
* My website is showing 0 errors and less warnings than all the other websites.
* All the other websites have more backlinks than me.
Now comes the questions.
* Out of the 3, I rank higher than 2 of them because of back links.
* I've been in contact with an SEO company that says my site is fast, and doesn't seem to be any issues, but also said there is a problem with traffic and back links.
* The said SEO company wants to charge me 500/month to up my ranking.
* SEO company also said that I should not engage with ad words as for my keyword they are $10+. I have confirmed this, as I was using adwords. SEO Company said that other companies selling the product are just outbidding each other on adwords and not optimizing their site.

Now for the questions:

1. Is NP's SEO autochecker a good site to use to get a rough estimate of where you stand in rankings?
2. In terms of SEO companies, do they ask you to make changes to your website to satisfy some SEO tests?
3. If it is against Google's terms to buy back links, how does SEO companies increase my back links if not from buying them?
4. At this point with my site ""optimized"" more than my competition, should I still hire an SEO company or is my money better going elsewhere to gain traction (ads, etc...)?


Apologies if some of these questions seem obvious. I can give more info if needed.

What I would like to do:

Advertise a new page on Google that contains all the same information as my product page currently does including the meta description, product images and title, but when a customer clicks on the ad they are instead redirected to my actual product page which contains a much cleaner less term heavy description. I have old URLs that we used to use for our products, and they currently just redirect to the updated product page but we do not advertise them.

Why I would like to do this:

* Title: Including key terms in a product title is necessary for visibility on most marketplaces, but on a product page I feel the title should simply be the product title and nothing else. Any key terms and information about the product should be in the description or in the images.
* Images: In a product highlight page, I do not want to be limited to square, white background images without text or backgrounds. Additionally, the images for our mobile website need to be different than the desktop version, but Google does not allow me to manually upload images to the feed that I'm aware of; having the same image twice in a different aspect would not be beneficial
* Multiple Pages: Currently Google will only allow us to advertise our product once despite their being different colors because the products all reside on the same URL, submitting the products twice violates Google's policy on duplicate listings as well as the images all being submitted on the same ad (so blue may appear as black because Google is snagging all the images on the page). If this method is viable, I would be able to feed different URLs for each of my products, and have them all redirect to the main page once the ad is clicked on.

I have researched this vehemently and cannot get a straight answer on whether this is possible, against policy or if there is an easier way. Google is strategically vague on this matter as far as policy which is no doubt to be able to take down listings as they see fit without allowing any clear workarounds.

We all know that site speed is essential. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Seconds:**

What is the golden number for:

* desktop
* mobile

I've read that 2seconds is best for desktop and from 3 to 4 seconds is best for mobile, but it seems to me a bit impossible for larger sites.

&amp;#x200B;

**Metrics:**

What metric should we use. I just started devouring this subject and I found so many metrics about the site speed like Avg. page load time (sec), TTFB (Time to first byte), PageSpeed insights' Optimization metric like 77 / 100.

Also should I trust Google Analytics' data for site speed.

&amp;#x200B;

**How to test site speed if we are not inhabiting the particular country:**

Like for example I'm from Bulgaria and I want to test the speed of the site in South Africa. In Bulgaria the internet connection is really fast compared to other countries and I can't be sure if the average user is experiencing problem with the page load.

&amp;#x200B;

Many sites for testing give me various results. How can I know the true site speed?

Any input would be greatly appreciated, and you&amp;#39;ll be saving me from temporary insanity.
