&amp;#x200B;

So this may be a bit tricky to explain but stick with me.  We're an IT consulting company, we're getting decent conversions on a a few of our ad groups, but there is one ad group that is not converting at all.  When I say converting I mean that we are getting click-throughs but no leads.   Other ad groups with lower CTR are getting better conversions with respect to lead generation.

&amp;#x200B;

My first thought (which could well be wrong) is the copy/content on the page.   I suspect that when people are searching for IT consultant and landing on a page that is geared towards consulting/strategy/outsourcing etc it is not what they intended and they are really looking for IT services (i.e. support, helpdesk, server management, etc).

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is that we already have an ad group and page optimised for IT services.  

&amp;#x200B;

My question is:  Do we optimise the content on the IT consulting page towards IT services, potentially duplicating content, or do we simply redirect the IT consulting ad group to the IT support/services landing page?  What is the best way to test this without impacting our current adwords campaigns and rankings?

Just found out one of my best friends didn’t pass the Bar Exam, so he’s looking for work until the next test. I have some experience with FB ads for my own business, but I’m by no means proficient.

He’s an award winning stage magician and has performed in Vegas and all over the country. He’s wanting to book more birthday parties locally, because it pays decently for a short amount of time. 

I’m setting him up a really simple landing page with a CTA like “Get $50 off when you book in advance”. Started looking at some FB ads, probably conversion based; was thinking local targeting and parents of children under 12ish above a certain income bracket . However it looks like some of the parent demographic targeting is about to be removed.

So my main store has made over $157K rev to date. Decent profit which I’m happy about. Without going into too much detail, I was wondering if any of y’all can help me with several tips.

It’s my main store as it has more of a brand presence and I actually bulk custom ordered a 2 of the 5 main products and shipped them out myself in order to save $, faster shipping, and add branding to the product. Furthermore, the other 3 are shipped within 9 days to a large majority of the countries I ship to

Do you guys have any tips on improvement or trial based on below:

* Retargeting (IG story only):  

   * 3 adsets for people who have: Viewed content, added to cart, or initiated checkout in the last 5 days.
   * All 3 adsets have their own unique but similar adcopy
   * All 3 adsets have over 6 ROAS with Initiate checkout (obviously) being highest at like 13 or 14
* Retargeting product that relates to whatever product I’m creating the said custom audience with (IG Story only):  

   * 3 adsets for people who have:  

      * Viewed content, added to cart, or initiated checkout in the last 20 days.
   * All 3 adsets have their own unique but similar adcopy
   * Just started this so the data isn’t like all the way there enough for me to say much
* Email/text marketing:  

   * Email sequences for people who abandon cart with decent recover rate
   * Waiting for a person that I follow to release his text sequences app so I can use that also.
   * Post purchase email sequences for post purchase purchase, working on fixing this though so I can get better results with this
* Cross/upselling:  

   * I currently have manual variants for certain products and each variant is a bogo starting at 1 for 25% off up to 5 for 50% off (I still make like a huge profit even with 50% off)

​

1. I know I need cross/upselling apps so if anyone has tips or ideas on which apps to checkout lmk.
2. In your LAA adsets, do you guys exclude other event LAAs (So let’s say you have a US 5-6% purchase LAA, you exclude all 30 (1-10%) other US LAAs for View Content, Add to Cart, and Initiate Checkout)? Or do you guys just exclude people who’ve seen the ad (3sec views) and/or viewed the product page? I’ve tried both and honestly can’t seem to really note any significant differrences.
3. Anyone have any resourceful links for manual bidding? Vertical scaling has it’s limits and I don’t want to test manual bidding without any UP TO DATE info. Thank y’all!
4. Any other strategies I may be missing for FB ad campaigns?
5. If you see anything else that I should be working on lmk!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys!&lt;/p&gt;

We&amp;#39;ve worked with several other agencies (MuteSix, Social Blue, Shoelace, Adroll) and have a good idea of what to expect in terms of ROI. Generating absolutely $0 in sales on $1550 in ad spend over the course of several weeks is a &lt;strong&gt;BIG RED FLAG&lt;/strong&gt;. When I brought this up to their support team on a phone call, they became hostile and immediately locked me out of our account. After speaking with some of their other clients, a former employee and speaking directly with Facebook, I&amp;#39;m afraid that Needls&amp;#39; service may be too good to be true or even worse, fraudulent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m curious what other&amp;#39;s experience have been like? Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

Most of the traffic is coming from remarketing audience clicks from people who have visited the site in the past 30 days but not requested a demo. 

Remaining 35% of traffic is a combination of similar audience + location &amp; interest overlays; so should be rather targeted.

We've had over 1500 hits to the landing page but only a handful of conversions.

Everyone who hits the landing page is added to another remarketing audience and followed up again with an FB lead ad + ads on Google Display with strong call-to-action.

Through June and July, we were seeing about 2 - 3 conversions per week through Google Ads, which is pretty good for our low volume, high-value ecommerce store. Near the beginning of August, we decided to put a little more money into the two campaigns that were producing conversions but marked as limited by budget, one Shopping campaign and one Search campaign, so we increased the daily budget on both of them. We have not had a single conversion since making that change.

Here are some notes:

* Conversions in this case refers to sales.
* The only other change we made around the time conversions stopped was to add a few exact match negative keywords for things unrelated to our products. We had been doing this regularly for the previous few months.
* Impressions and clicks did not increase or decrease significantly.
* We only changed the daily budget for the campaigns. We did not change our bids.
* Our pricing is still competitive, so I don't think this is an issue with comparison shopping any more than it would have been when our ads were converting.
* Organic traffic and conversions for August were as good if not a bit better than they were in June and July.
* When I was digging through my Google Ads account the other day, the graph for one of my ad groups showed a conversion for this past Sunday. There was no conversion value associated with it, and the table below the graph reported zero conversions. Today, the graph no longer shows that conversion.
* The order confirmation page I use for conversion tracking has not changed.
* Google Ads is seeing the conversion tracking tag on my website, but says the last conversion it recorded was on August 15. Nowhere else does Google Ads report a conversion for August 15, and I cannot find any evidence of a PPC conversion for that date in any of the analytics tools I use. As best as I can tell, the last PPC conversion was August 4.
* Ads are showing at roughly the same times of day as they were before. Shopping ads are blowing through the daily budget before noon every day, even though the delivery method is set to standard, but that was the case in June and July as well.

The most viable hypothesis I've been able to come up with so far is that our Google Ads account is haunted. Anyone have any ideas?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is baffling to me.&lt;/p&gt;

There was no conversion value associated with it, and the table below the graph reported zero conversions. Today, the graph no longer shows that conversion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The order confirmation page I use for conversion tracking has not changed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Ads is seeing the conversion tracking tag on my website, but says the last conversion it recorded was on August 15. Nowhere else does Google Ads report a conversion for August 15, and I cannot find any evidence of a PPC conversion for that date in any of the analytics tools I use. As best as I can tell, the last PPC conversion was August 4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ads are showing at roughly the same times of day as they were before. Shopping ads are blowing through the daily budget before noon every day, even though the delivery method is set to standard, but that was the case in June and July as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most viable hypothesis I&amp;#39;ve been able to come up with so far is that our Google Ads account is haunted. Anyone have any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;

Your website could be loading so slow analytics isn't loading before people bounce. (has a 1.9s load time)

You could have some sort of redirect on the page causing it to lose attribution during the redirect. (no redirects)

You could have people clicking on extensions that don't lead people to the website (e.g. call extension) and so a session is never recorded. (they don't have extensions setup on their adwords account)

* Pushing promotions through Headline Text Ad Copy vs Sitelinks - There is a trade off:

This can hurt Quality Score and Increase CPC's - the trade off is if performance makes up more the upfront deficit.

We're getting mixed results so far using Universal App Campaigns (UAC) - our campaigns are showing 200 installs per day, but we haven't seen an uptick in total Android downloads in the Playstore console.  The fear is that many of our PPC installs might simply be cannibalized from our organic Playstore traffic.  

From the adwords metrics side, \~77% of our conversions are coming from the Google search network, which includes Playstore ads.  I spent some time on the phone yesterday with Adwords support - unfortunately they were flat out wrong with some of the things they told me, and had to backtrack when i pointed it out, so I'm looking for additional advice.  Having done some research, I understand that cannibalization isn't a new concern in PPC.  I just haven't seen anyone break it down for mobile app marketing and the Playstore in particular.  

So a couple of questions:

1. Is there any way to a) restrict UAC ads from showing in the playstore? I'm guessing no, since UAC settings are so minimal.
2. Is there any way to at least measure what proportion of your clicks/conversions can be attributed to the playstore vs other parts of the Google Search network?  This seems like it would be a fundamental need in doing ROI calcs.

* ALL coming from custom audience of people who have Initiated Checkout, Added to Cart, and Viewed Content.

​

I'm trying to setup FB ads for a client however I am running into some issues. I've posted a question on the official FB forum but that was back on Monday and still no response (I don't think they have a direct phone number either). Anyway here's the question:

​

​

The question is self explanatory - I have been granted access to a page - and when I go to [facebook.com/ads](https://facebook.com/ads) I can create an ad for that page with a custom audience - however I would really prefer to do it in Facebook Business Manager - my understanding is that this is much more professional - however I have no idea how everything works.

I have been granted access to a FB page - and I can create the ad from my page as you can see:

[http://prntscr.com/ko4fyb](http://prntscr.com/ko4fyb)

However when I go into Facebook Business Manager I don't know how to create the ad:

[http://prntscr.com/ko4gm6](http://prntscr.com/ko4gm6)

​

IN the screenshot above you can see that it has a bunch of accounts - but if i've been granted access to a page what I want to do is:

1. Have the client enter in their credit card details so the ads are charged on their behalf
2. get access to the audience of the Facebook Page that I have been granted to! (from FB Business Manager)

I feel like I'm going around in circles here but anyone that is in the know - your help would be much appreciated.

My business partner just turned down an embarrassing offer from a charity that wants to be our client.  
When my partner does sales on her own, I mentor her and only get involved once it's time to hammer out a contract.  This time, the client low-balled us, requesting a $200 per month management fee.  It was a great learning experience for her because she didn't want to say ""No.""  Although I would have been SO proud if she countered with a fair offer right away, or even turned them down, she told them that she has to discuss it with her business partner.  
Obviously, $200 doesn't even cover the cost of the time my partner and I spend discussing and reporting on the account.  Even more, a Google grants account is more difficult to manage because of the requirements to stay active. E.g. the account must stay above 5% CTR and CPC is capped at $2, among other requirements.  
She and I spoke at length about the disadvantages of discounting our work.  I explained to her that we would be forgoing future work from a well-paying client, because of our commitment to this charity; we would be choosing to work for someone that doesn't value our contribution. etc.    
So, we countered their offer with a very fair management fee which they declined, as predicted.  Their excuse is that it's too expensive for their budget.  The potential client told us that their previous PPC manager was a grad student who was doing it ""for experience"" up until the account was suspended for not meeting standards.

My coworker and I were discussing this and it got me thinking; now I just want to know for sure what the best strategy going forward since the single Shopping campaign I've been overseeing has been in the toilet since day 1.

&amp;#x200B;

It's always been my understanding that the description for each shopping product is supposed to be as full as possible without being media-rich and too format-rich. So, good grammar, good usability, good design, essentially copy and paste the description from the landing page. Google even states this verbatim in the help manual. I thought that the title and the description are parsed for keywords, but the title is weighed more heavily.

&amp;#x200B;

My coworker disagrees, and for relatively good reason: he's stating that it's better to list keywords and key phrases separated with commas as the description. I immediately disagreed, until I saw that he'd previously done this for a Shopping campaign, albeit still including the full description afterwards, with pretty good success—the info he was putting in the description couldn't be found on the landing page despite being crucial for ensuring compatibility, so it at least put the product on the SERP. My coworker still thinks that the full description shouldn't be included, just the keywords.

Can you help me solve this issue? I'm having a bit of a nightmare with it. I've recently started to run custom conversion campaigns for the first time, I'm driving leads for a Home Improvement company. I've just come back from a week off work (didn't check my business manager ONCE!) and the lead results are a confusing mess.


Conversions (set in ad set to 7 day click 1 day view) - 1

Leads (ad account is set to 28 day click 7 day view) - 41


Okay, so what I'm extrapolating from this is that by broadening the attribution model this campaign has gone from horrifying failure to riproaring success. Great. But, then I checked the custom conversion itself, and the events &gt; leads in analytics for this domain, and got the following:


Custom Conversions (set to event: lead on this domain): 23

Events &gt; Lead (in Analytics, on this domain): 12


Why aren't these the same? And where is Facebook pulling the '41' website leads from above from if that many haven't even apparently happened on the site?

&lt;p&gt;I figured I can use the Google AdSense Keyword Planner to get an idea about how much traffic a campaign will generate for a given budget. My question would be how reliable these estimates are? If these figures would be reliable the conversion rate would be the only uncertain indicator in my revenue forecast. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for all your help!&lt;/p&gt;

We've come across several instances over the past few months of new clients that we inherited their accounts where they have been running direct on Fuelx.  The client feedback is almost unanimously ""this seems too good to be true, and we're not sure about the incrementality here, but we don't have any proof to say otherwise"".

I don't have proof either, but here are some themes that I've identified consistently across clients that run Fuelx, and I'm curious if others have experience with them and have seen the same:

* GA reported Conversion Rate is the highest of any channel - 7% on video remarketing &amp; 6% on video prospecting vs. email at 4% vs. FB remarketing at 2% (their revenue &amp; traffic split is nearly 50/50 remarketing/prospecting)
* GA reported % new visits on remarketing campaigns is \~40%.  Remarketing should be closer to 5% new (assuming some missing data from cookie clearing, ad blockers, cross device, etc.)
* GA conversion paths reporting - this one is pretty damning.  Nearly 70% of all revenue for Fuelx is reported as 1 touch.   How could that be happening if 50% of the revenue is attributed to remarketing?  Also going back to that conversion rate - how in the hell could video prospecting ads drive an abnormally high conversion rate and be the only touch point?

All of this points to some form of cookie stuffing - similar to what Steelhouse was accused of in the Criteo vs. Steelhouse lawsuit a few years back.  Basically Fuelx is most likely engineering their platform to create a new cookie &amp; visitor session and somehow intersecting the user just before conversion to grab conversions from other channels.

This post  from a few months ago lends more credence my assumption: [https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/8lge2x/anyone\_use\_fuelx/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/8lge2x/anyone_use_fuelx/)

This is difficult to prove right now since these clients are not running through an adserver like DoubleClick, so there is a lack of central source of truth other than GA, which isn't that robust.  

Have others worked with Fuelx and drawn similar conclusions?

Very top of the funnel. So initial signup doesn't take much consideration/convincing. Most people convert on the first click withing minutes. So conversion window is short. No repeat visits to convert. Usually done on the same device in the same browsing session.


But.


I won't know about the quality of a lead until much later in the process. Process similar to multiple repeated sales on the back end. Maybe a month later, maybe more. Maybe once, maybe multiple times.


So...


Browsers are increasingly getting more and more cookie-averse. Google keeps mentioning how we need to combine GCLID with Analytics global tag to use first-party cookies instead of using their third-party cookies for conversion tracking. They are now using cross-device conversions and statistical methods to recover lost conversions (or invent those that never happened), and so on. We can no longer out out of it.


In any case, cookies don't live very long anymore. And plenty of users sign up on one device and follow-up on another. Then switch back to the first device and so on.


So I'm thinking about enabling auto-tagging, collecting GCLID on my end, and switching to ""offline"" conversion import. Either by scheduling scripting or by using AdWords API to make the process automatic.


The way my business is set up, I can account for maybe 95%+ of conversions by simply tying the initial click's GCLID with user data I maintain on my end all through the entire relationship with this lead/customer/user. And all future actions/sales/conversions of this user.


Initially, I thought about using offline conversion import just for the backend actions. But then I thought, why not unify and simply switch to using offline/imported conversions for everything. Even for the initial signup conversion.


So I would have no event tags (global tag, etc.) firing at all. Instead, I would maintain GCLID on my end. And then import it when the conversion happens.


Is there some downside I'm missing? Something obvious?


Assuming that maintaining GCLID on my end is not a technical challenge, is there something else I need to consider before moving to using ""offline"" conversions for tracking ""online"" conversions?

not sure if you remember but i made a post back a couple of weeks ago about some answers i put through for a Digital Coordinator role where SEM is the main focus.

Anyway, i smashed that, and the follow up interview out of the park and the agencies HR rep emailed me saying the next (and hopefully final) step is a cognitive ability assessment which she will ""send through to me"".

Keep in mind this is for an entry level position.

Anyway, does anyone know exactly what a cognitive ability assessment entails? I've had a look online and i presume it's that type of test that gives you 4 different image options and you have to the most accurate one for the given question. However so many of the practice tests i look online call it something different, some tests are just not what i think will be in the actual assessment etc.

Has anyone here done a cognitive ability assessment for an SEM related position they have interviewed for?

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. I just thought i would post it here since the entry level position i'm interviewing for has a big focus on SEM.

I'm looking for some advice on how to structure my Amazon PPC campaigns. I'd be grateful if someone could help or direct me to someone to advise me.

I have around 15 products - most of which have colour variations.

Here's my website - [Beddoes Products](https://beddoesproducts.com/)

There is very low search volume for the longtail keywords related to each product. For example, my product Roof Tile Vent To Fit Marley Ludlow Major Roof Tiles"" - the keyword ""marley ludlow major roof tile vent"" has very few searches but I do still want to show up when that term is used.

Most people would only search ""roof tile vent"" or ""roof ventilation tile"" without the brand and tile profile.

So my question is, should I: 

A) Create 1 campaign and select all of my products and use the more generic keywords ""roof tile vent"", ""roof ventilation tiles"", ""vented roof tiles"" and then separate campaigns for each product with more specific keywords like ""marley ludlow major roof tile vent""?

B) Create separate campaigns for each product and add both keywords - ""roof tile vent"" and ""marley ludlow major roof tile vent"" to each product campaign?

So I could have 1 product called ""Roof Tile Vent To Fit Redland 49"" using ""roof tile vents"" and ""redland 49 roof tile vent"" as keywords.

And another product called ""Roof Tile Vent To Fit Marley Modern"" using ""roof tile vents"" and ""marley modern roof tile vents"".

How would you go about it?

Thank you if you took the time to read this.

Right now all employees use the same login to access all of our client accounts. We have about 140 clients in there, and each digital marketer manages about 25-40 clients.

What’s the best way for me to give my employees access to their own accounts and make sure I have one central login still? I’m hoping to mitigate risk a little better and want my employees to have their own logins so we can see who makes changes.

Any input is appreciated! Thanks! ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

Our business strategy is such that we really only want to be drawing traffic from ""SKU Specific"" search queries.  Although I saw some indication it might not work, including from this forum, I wanted to try setting the bids in my funnel or sieve campaign at $0.01 and see the results myself. 

How its Structured:

\- Products Separated at the Ad Group Level

\- Budget Shared

Campaign 1 - The Funnel

\- High Priority

\- Enhanced CPC Bid: $0.01

\- Negative Keywords: All SKU's

Campaign 2 - SKU Specific

\- Medium Priority

\- Enhanced CPC Bid (Varies, based on historical data wherever possible)

\- Negative Keywords: Our Standard List

The result so far is that we have not had one single impression. This is NOT the result I expected. Bear in mind I am knew to AdWords relatively speaking so maybe I am missing something because from what I can tell all the products are eligible. 

I understand there is a bidding threshold, but even if the first campaign couldn't meet it the second absolutely should have. So I appeal to those more knowledgeable than I because as far as I can tell either the bids are ALL too low in Campaign 2 (unlikely) or not meeting the bid threshold on Campaign 1 is preventing Campaign 2 from Bidding (which again makes no sense to me given the negative keywords and how priority supposedly works).

I'm just taking a course on digital marketing and there is a part that explains ""How to price paid traffic"" I'm gonna try to explain what this module says and then ask you, experienced marketers for clarification.

The course says that you need to first find (or get from the business owner) yearly value of the customer.

times

How many costumes you think you can bring them every month.

equals

your value divided 2.

equals

your service fee +ad spend 

That way you are giving them 2x ROI

**Example**

Dental Practice:

If the average patient schedules 2 appointments a year for hygiene and exams at $400/each, and then a major case every three years costing around $2500, then we can figure that your patient's lifetime value is $1,633 per year. This was calculated by taking the $400 and doubling it for the exams  and then dividing $2500 by 3 to get the yearly amount

Yearly customer Value: $1,633

The conversion formula:

10 leads = 5 Appointments 

5 Appointments = 1 customers 

10 leads = 1 customers = $1,633 a year for the dental practice

If I bring them 10 leads and they can get 5 Appointments (for whatever promotion offer that I have done on FB) 

and then they manage to convert 1 costumer from those 5 appointments, the value that they get per year is $1,633.

The course then says that if you bring them 4 costumes (40 leads) you bring the business value of $6,532 and therefore you can charge for this service up to $3,266 monthly ($2000 service fee + $1000 ad spend) and you still get them 2x ROI.

**My problem with this**

Now the problem that I have with this is, that the dental practice makes a profit of $6,532 but that's not a net profit, net profit might be 30% (and I think I'm being really generous here) that means that they actually make only $ 1,959. In this case, they would be actually losing money by paying an agency $3k a month.

I'm really struggling to understand how to set up your prices and still get the business ROI, especially for someone like restaurants where their net income is around 5%-15%.

 after all, that's the reason for offering this service, you want them to make money, but you also want to make money your self.

I hope that this question makes sense, and I really appreciate your help.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hi everyone!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I come come from SEO and I have a question about Adwords.

**The case:**

We want to be really aggressive about our Black Friday campaign this year. We are going to 302 redirect most of our pages which have Adwords ads to our Black Friday campaign page, which is on the same domain.

[example.com/shoes/](https://example.com/shoes/) 302 redirect to [example.com/black-friday/](https://example.com/black-friday/)

**The question:**

Can we somehow exclude Google Ads Bot from these changes?

I know that if the ads have redirecting URLs they are going to be stopped and our Adwords account can be banned.

So we were advised to check our server logs and to see how Google Ads Bot is crawling our website, but there is no trace of Google Ads Bot yet.

The goal of checking the server logs is to have some sort of parameter that will help us exclude Google Ads Bot from the redirects. What I mean is when this bot enters the site it woud not be redirected and it will see only the 200 OK link.

Have someone tried this kind of aggressive promotion with Adwords ads running and what were the results?

To continue  reporting conversions accurately, you'll need to update your conversion  tagging to use the global site tag (gtag.js) or link your Google  Analytics account.""

I don't link AdWords to Analytics (integration is not enabled). I do use GTAG. The tag was generated by my Analytics account and then I added AdWords account to it, but never linked AdWords and Analytics. I have been using it for many months now since I switched from the old conversion tracking tags, and it works fine. AdWords conversion tracking works as expected.

I have my reasons not to link AdWords and Analytics. So all the times Google reps have been trying to get me to enable auto-tagging and enable Analytics integration, I've been ignoring them.

I still don't want to link AdWords and Analytics, but in light of cookie handing/privacy issues (and it's only going to get worse), I would like to utilize gclid parameter to help AdWords tracking.

\*So the question is:\* Would enabling auto-tagging but without linking Analytics, with gtag (for both Analytics accounts and AdWords accounts through respective gtag 'config') allow AdWords to utilize gclid to track conversions when browsers restrict cookies?

If I understand it correctly, when gclid parameter is present, Analytics code executed on the page makes a note of it, and uses first-party cookie (since it's executed on my page) to make the tracking stick in cases when third-party cookie would get discarded.

Does that only work if I link AdWords and Analytics? Or would it work for unlinked accounts too?

We are a manufacturer and wholesaler (B2B) of industrial clamping products such as hose clamps and so-called P-clips. We are a relatively small player in the market but have a steady flow of new customers coming from search engine advertising.

However, we also have a steady flow of consumers clicking on our ads and then inquiring for 1 or 10 clamps. This is obviously not the audience we are targeting. It is however understandable since hose clamps and p-clips are widely used in and around people's houses and gardens.

Our target audience are B2B purchasers and engineers who are either in the process of sourcing clamps or incorporating them into 3D drawings. To bring down the amount of clicks from consumers we lowered the mobile phone / tablet bids by 80%, since our feeling is that the purchasers in our market don't really use these devices in their jobs. Consumers, on the other hand are more likely to use them. We also try to use B2B-related language in our advertisments such as ""for OEMs and wholesalers"" or ""large quantities"".

* I have a Shopify Pet Store, no previous traffic or customers. 
* I have Facebook Pixel and Analytics
* I try targeting audiences like ""dogs"" or other companies like ""petsmart"" and audiences that likes ""dogs"" &amp; ""petsmart"" but hardly got any traffic. My budget is about $10 daily and ran it for about a week before I turn it off.
* I am using 3 video ads of a 30 second video that displays the product.
* When I run a conversion campaign I hardly get any traffic, If I run an Engagement campaign I do get engagement to the same audiences.
* I setup the conversion to ""Purchased"" and later read someone that since I didn't have any previous conversions I should lower it to ""Add to Cart""
* Since the traffic has been so low I haven't setup my retargetting campaign.

Maybe people are not buying because it's cold traffic, my product is well priced.

Some of the strategies I thought was to setup an awareness campaign using my daily content and show my ad only to people who have watched 75% of my videos, likes, shared my other posts or read a blog post. And show my retargetting to people that visited my product page and not just my home page.

Im running a **facebook ad campaign** and i have a **landing page** created with a second page that contains only buttons/links to take the visitor to the partners pages where they can purchase the product.

i have been searching for solution for quite long to figure it out how is it possible to track button clicks on a page that i created. I know how can i track one button for example a CTA button on a landing page.

**My scenario is:**

I have a Landing page where i show a product and at the bottom of the page there is a CTA button what takes you to a **second page** where i have **12 buttons** (with unique ID-s like buttonID01, buttonID02, buttonID03 ... etc.).

So my goal would be to see how many times did they click on my **button 01** which took them to my partners page and how many times did they click on the **second button and so on.** So i can have a clear picture how many times the buttons have been clicked so that means they went to my partners shopping page.

I have been checking out Facebook developers documentation on the to  **Track In-Page Events** especially for buttons.

Here is how they say it can be done (ofc. it can be done in many other ways):

     &lt;button onClick=""fbq('track', 'Purchase');""&gt;Button Text&lt;/button&gt; 

or  you could create a function that pushes the event. 

    &lt;script&gt;
    function onClick() {
    fbq('track', 'Purchase');
    };
    &lt;/script&gt;

These are great for one button but how can i track more different button clicks separately.

**So in facebook ad manager i can see if they clicked on the first button 12 times on the second button 20 times and so on.**

I would really appriciate the help because i have been trying for days many things without any success.

\-Negative keywords are added regularly to campaigns ( all one word or two words search terms are added as exact match negatives to weed out searches of top of the funnel)

\-Almost 60% of Feed  titles are optimized ( 400 products in total)

\-Product groups are divided by product type

\- I kept changing bidding on product level and campaign level but that did not make a difference

\-I had my campaigns set up to enhanced cpc bidding but google rep asked me to turn it off because I only had 13 conversions in the past 30 days so I did. I am on manual bidding now

\- I turned on smart goals in GA and imported it into AW ( around the time that conversions stopped)

I know that my budget is really small and I do not have the money to invest into a professional service to run my campaigns. I hired someone from upwork but it turned out to be a complete disaster so I started managing it on my own.

For a while, one of my biggest lead drivers has been AdWords. Recently, Google launched “Google Local Services” in my area and apart from it taking me more than a month to actually sign up, for no reason, even with daily calls to Google, it’s been extraordinarily frustrating. What I’ve been seeing is a major drop off in CTR on my AdWords campaigns - explained probably by the  “local services” bar they place at the top of the page with “google guaranteed” vendors. 

Local services listings flattens the playing field and makes it impossible to actually stand out (vs being able to write better copy, adjust bids, etc.). We’ve got a ton of honest reviews and a 5 star average, but google will just as happily display a company with a single 5 star review as “5 Stars”. If you want to be listed first, you can, for $21 per phone call - which wouldn’t be an outrageous cost, but the platform definitely encourages price shopping since every provider’s profile ultimately looks the same. 

What can be done? Any local services businesses that have been hit by this? How are you working around this? We’ve had an amazing growth year leading up to this and I feel like we’re hitting a wall with this new frustrating change. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

I've been a in-house PPC specialist for just over a year now, and I was hoping to get some insight regarding managing large accounts/platforms.

Background: I've been employed by the same company for just over a year, and prior to this I learned PPC while interning at a company who used Facebook as a sole provider of app downloads. I'm talking a monthly budget of $100k, and part of a three person team (Intern, Specialist, Manager).   


My current company started PPC off fairly slow. They ran little to nothing on Facebook, Adwords or any other PPC platform prior to my arrival, which I quickly ramped up. The whole company has been extremely happy with my results, and they've given me more and more responsibility in attaining large, and sometimes lofty goals.   


Issue: I'm starting to feel worn down by the quantity of campaigns I have to manage. Our business deals with very niche audiences across thousands of locations. At any given moment I am running 50 or so FB campaigns (At one point I was running 125) with a budget in the thousands per day. Now we're planning to expand Adwords, but my time is locked into Facebook. My day-to-day work consists solely of managing what we have at this time, with little to no time set aside to try experiments, new platforms or anything that I believe would give us new avenues/ways to acquire users. I have voiced these concerns, but to little to no avail.   


Every day another task is placed in my lap, and I fully believe that despite taking the time to set up a new platform or campaign(s), I cannot give it the full attention it deserves.

What I would like to know is what is reasonable for someone to manage on their own within a 9-5 job, and what type of salary (Canada/Toronto) should I be expecting? 

Thanks!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello PPC!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been a in-house PPC specialist for just over a year now, and I was hoping to get some insight regarding managing large accounts/platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Background: I&amp;#39;ve been employed by the same company for just over a year, and prior to this I learned PPC while interning at a company who used Facebook as a sole provider of app downloads. I&amp;#39;m talking a monthly budget of $100k, and part of a three person team (Intern, Specialist, Manager).   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current company started PPC off fairly slow. They ran little to nothing on Facebook, Adwords or any other PPC platform prior to my arrival, which I quickly ramped up. The whole company has been extremely happy with my results, and they&amp;#39;ve given me more and more responsibility in attaining large, and sometimes lofty goals.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Issue: I&amp;#39;m starting to feel worn down by the quantity of campaigns I have to manage. Our business deals with very niche audiences across thousands of locations. At any given moment I am running 50 or so FB campaigns (At one point I was running 125) with a budget in the thousands per day. Now we&amp;#39;re planning to expand Adwords, but my time is locked into Facebook. My day-to-day work consists solely of managing what we have at this time, with little to no time set aside to try experiments, new platforms or anything that I believe would give us new avenues/ways to acquire users. I have voiced these concerns, but to little to no avail.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day another task is placed in my lap, and I fully believe that despite taking the time to set up a new platform or campaign(s), I cannot give it the full attention it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I would like to know is what is reasonable for someone to manage on their own within a 9-5 job, and what type of salary (Canada/Toronto) should I be expecting? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

We provide Universal App Campaigns (Google Ads) for our customer, which leads people directly to the App Store page where they can install.

After installation, users will have to register through a button in-app, which will bring the user to a registration form in a browser. Sadly those registrations cannot be reduced to the Universal App Campaign, because the tracking is 'lost' when clicking the 'Register' button in-app.

To make it schematically:

Universal App Campaign --&gt; App Store --&gt; Install --&gt; Open app --&gt; \*Tap Register --&gt; Go to browser --&gt; Register

Just finished my site using bootstrap ( some of the text content still needs to be edited ). I want to ask about using google , bing or facebook ads.

Let's say I specialize in graphic or screen design, with web experience ( bootstrap and wordpress ). 

1. I want to promote my site or service, should I use google or facebook ads?
2. I have a limited budget but if this ad gives me multiple clients I will think of maintaining it in the future.
3. Similar to question 1 , I'm thinking of creating designs for a teespring account or something similar, and using ads to draw more customers. Do you think this is a good idea ?

I'm not usually one to post up generic ""help me please"" posts, but my ads are not performing AT ALL compared to which they used to last year.

I'll post my info below:

**Industry:** Junk/Garbage Removal.  
**Area:** Chose radius about 10km around a specific location, which I want to keep. Large city.  
**Budget:** I currently have just over $5,000 in credit on my account, and hope to make the best of it over the next couple of months.  
I'm running **search/text ads** and targeting front page, top of search. People are sent to my landing page.  
Current land on search results is about **3.8 - 4.4.**  
The value of a conversion to me ranges from $150 - $600+   
**Current CTR &amp; CPC:** 2.8% - 3% and $3.50.  
**Keywords** are pretty darn generic, includes negatives such as *free*, and areas that I don't service yet.  
**Daily budget** is set to $40, but it hasn't been hitting this amount at all, maybe around $15 a day. I would like to increase the budget once I know my ads are converting better.

I really just want to generate more leads, and more people either calling my business and/or booking the service online. Hence the landing page. Seems as though the people clicking the ads do not call or book the service as often as they should for someone clicking the ad.. I created these advertisements last year, and they performed great. Not so much anymore. Should I create an entirely new campaign?

Dear Google Ads Advertiser,

My question is universal (i.e.: applies to all sorts of advertising platform). In general, is it better to optimize for CPA or conversion volume?

Let's say a campaign had 2 ads:

Ad 1: Total spend = $5,000; conversion = 200; cost per conversion (CPA) = $25

Ad 2: Total spend = $33,750; conversion = 450; cost per conversion (CPA) = $75

So, Ad 1 has a much lower (better) CPA ($25) but lower conversion volume (200), whereas Ad 2 has a much higher conversion volume (450), but much higher (worse) CPA ($75). That's a dilemma!

I manage FB ads for a retailer and I have always wondered about the effect of using page boosts. 
  
  
About 99% of the ads that I set up are focused on driving ROI, and typically always use Conversion optimization. However, I have had some success with page boosting to Fans/Friends Of Fans. If I get lucky, I can drive a solid ROI for a fraction of the CPC. A small budget of $10 can drive decent revenue and a solid $0.02-$0.04 cents per click versus $.25+ for conversion.  Usually I will just hit the button to boost on the page post in addition to segmenting out web traffic/custom audiences etc. 
  
That being said, I am wondering why the Link Click CPC is so low for these types of ads. I understand they are optimized towards driving engagement but does this mean they get a decent placement/frequency for who I am targeting? 
  
  
Basically I just want to understand what is the exact difference between engagement optimized ads vs conversion optimized ads? Are these ads different in any way such as behave differently or have better placement in terms of delivery? Does a boosted post look any different than a conversion ad with a page post creative?

This is much easier with SEO, since you can conduct site audits, keyword research, competitor analysis, and more without your own website. You can pretend some website owner is your client, crawl their website for errors, etc.

But with PPC, you have to design a landing page and claim ownership over one yourself.

I would like to ask for some advice, I'm a bit noob in this area.

I'm a freelance graphic designer, and about 3 weeks ago I have started to use google ads to improve my business. I have gave a budget of 1 USD/day.  

My problem is that google ads targets mostly asian countries like India, Bangladesh, Pakistan etc. while I'm living in the middle of Europe. It's a bit frustrating because I won't get any potential clients from that Area, while when I have targeted Eu and the US there weren't any that much visitors than expected, so regarding to these informations this problem it's maybe because of my budget, but I don't want to test/waste money without rhyme or reason so I'd like to ask some help about this..

Any type of suggestions/help are very welcome.

I know this is a common gripe with Adwords/Google Ads, but I've come across something I've never seen before and just wanted to see what everyone else's experience was..

It was my understanding that if you're on a bid optimisation strategy then Google can overspend on your budget, assuming that it comes in on target for an average month. So if you have £10 a day then it can overspend more than twice that amount on any given day assuming the total for the month doesn't go over about £300 in total. This is obviously terrible as you can't control it on a granular basis, but I thought it was limited solely to optimisation strategies.

I've recently experienced a bunch of campaigns spending way more than the daily budget, but all of them are on Manual CPC, not even with enhanced CPC. Has this changed recently??

It's a total pain in the arse because I now have to explain to a client why I've overspent by about £300 with 2 days still to go in the month. Screw you Google, you utter twats.

I'm asking the community to help me figure out this problem. I have run several mid-budget ($1000/day) campaigns in Facebook in the past, my total spend is about $60,000. In my experience, even during the learning phase, Facebook picks up the campaigns fairly fast and tries to spend all your budget.

Recently I have set up 3 new campaigns and they have been running for days or weeks without getting any significant reach. Their audience (LAL) is in the millions, bidding is ""lowest-cost"" without a cap, the content is fine (no text, some old, some new), generally optimized for purchases.

It's very frustrating, I don't understand why they don't get any reach (well, a few dozens a day) and how is Facebook going to ever go through the learning phase at this pace.

Things I have tried:

* change conversion event to upper in the funnel
* change audiences 
* check for overlapping audiences 
* change bidding to target cost
* duplicate ad sets and try running again
* checking with a Facebook support rep that I don't have some sort of shadow-ban

None of them helped.

Your advice would be much appreciated.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi there,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some clients can&amp;#39;t afford for this disapproval to turn into a long protracted service outtage, so they&amp;#39;re literally just uninstalling the software. Anyone else being impacted? &lt;/p&gt;

This is the link: www.lojaartepratica.com.br. 

Now I'm going to start a face ads campaign and would like to use you help. 

This is what I'm thinking about how to structure the campaign:

I have already some traffic from our IG page so my pixel have some activity. The numbers from last 7 days are 379 ViewContent and 28 InitiateCheckout.

Because of that, I'm thinking about starting my campaign optimizing for WC ViewContent.

I'm gonna run 12 dynamic carousel ads for 4 days to test the following:

* 3 different copy;
* 2 placements (IG feed and Facebook News Feed);
* 2 audiences (300k people segmented by interests and demographics and 1% lookalike from 20k people who have interacted with my IG page)

Planning on running those 12 ads in 12 different adsets with a $5 daily budget. Gonna set the conversion window for 7 days so it gathers more data, since I don't have a lot of traffic yet.

After 4 days, I'm gonna select the two ads with the lowest cost/result, duplicate the adsets and set a 30$ daily budget.

So what do you guys think about my planning so far? Is it about right? Any tips?

After that, things get a little cloudy for me. What do I do after I start getting 50+ InitiateCheckout activity per week? Do I edit the adset to optimize for InitiateCheckout? Do I create a new adset and run both InitiateCheckout and ViewContent together?

I've been getting more and more frustrated as functionality is removed from Facebook ads.

Comparing two audiences for income/net worth breakdowns was tremendously useful too, etc etc.

Since taking over an account about 2 weeks ago (mid Jul), there has been a sharp decrease in the  Clicks (dropped by half) for my display campaign. As a result of the significant decrease in clicks, the CTR has also increased. I do not recall making any changes to the campaign (have checked Adword's change history to confirm, and no changes have been reflected in the history), and am wondering what could have attributed to the decrease.

I have checked the site analytics, and was notified that there was a significantly longer page load load time for the landing page URL during the month of June. Could that have also contributed to a lower quality score, and hence to the sharp decrease in clicks and impressions?

During my online research, i read that there may be competitors who are bidding for similar keywords and audiences more aggressively, which have resulted in my display ad being shown less. Is that a possibility, and if yes, is there a way to check the competition?

**Some info about the campaign**

Bidding Strategy - vCPM

CTR for Ad - Very poor

Targeting - Keywords &amp; Audience

Ad Groups - 1

Ad Copy - 1

Daily Budget - Limited (have been notified that the ads stopped running on one of the busiest days)

**An Update:**

I'ved checked the trend of the clicks &amp; impressions over the past month, and noticed something a little strange. The trend of the impressions has largely remained consistent. However the trend for the clicks seem not to have been affected by the impressions.

**Clicks**

4 July - 8 July: Clicks increased till an all time peak

8 - 10 July: Clicks dropped by half

10 - 19 July: Clicks continued to decrease till an all time low (1/4 of the clicks on 8 July)

19 July - now: Clicks are gradually increasing, and have reached the same number of clicks on 4 July (1/2 of original number)

**Impressions**

4 - 8 July: Impressions dropped by 1000

8 - 10 July: Impressions **increased** by 1000

10 - 19 July: Impressions increased by 1000

19 July - now: Impressions decreased by 1000

Now, you’re already using it if you use Bing Ads—but it’s possible no one told you.

You have to sneakily shut it off for all Bing Ads campaigns by adding a bid adjustment in campaign settings at the *very* bottom. (And if you’ve wondered why Bing Ads suddenly started spending all of your money more quickly with questionable results and a strange reporting row called “audience total, this is why).

But back to the topic at-hand. Using image extensions and Google-style propensity to turn text-based/search ads into display ads, Bing Ads’ “audience” functionality does the same thing; that is, activates display-style advertising across their partner network.

So how do you use it? Create search ads in Bing Ads and add image extensions. Give them a bid amount of 25% of what you normally would for minimal performance (that is, undercut the search ad bids so they won’t perform/spend much of anything).

Then in campaign settings, go to the bottom and add an “audience” bid adjustment of ‘increase by 300%’.
($10 bid times .25= $2.50 +300%increase[$7.50] = original $10 target bid, for example).

Welcome to the display network: back-asswords Microsoft style.

Your reporting is in the “audience total” row of most campaign/ad groups/keywords views (aka place to which your adspend has been mysteriously going for the last couple months).

You were very helpful with my last post, whereby I was struggling with whether or not to continue Facebook ads. 

I have just finished a AdWords campaign - my first whereby I have set everything up correctly (different ads, landing pages etc)

I spent £100 on the ads. Sadly, no results yet (my ultimate goal is to sell my products - decor and furniture serving the mid - high end markets/affordable luxury)

Now, of course I'm conscious of wasting money, but from you advice I recognise the need to be a bit more relaxed about spend. 

This weekend, I'm going to try and start afresh. Say, for example, spend £200 on ads. I'm struggling to pinpoint my exact market in all honesty. There is so much information on the internet which can be overwhelming and never quite sure what direction to go in.

Ultimately, I'd love to understand how you would approach this PPC campaign. Is Facebook worth another shot? If I do another AdWords campaign with the same campaign details as I have just done, will this likely lead to another £100 in wasted spend?

Your advice and expertise would be very much appreciated!!

I have an ecommerce site which is a couple of years old. We sell high-value spiritual jewellery (c.$1000/item) worldwide. Last year our turnover was roughly $500k which is great. However, almost all sales were from our organic efforts on Instagram. We have grown a very loyal (20k following). Unfortunately our team lacks the necessary digital expertise to expand and diversify away from Instagram. I’m looking for someone to help increase sales through PPC or digital marketing.

We've started to release some free mcc level scripts.

I wanted to share the first one which is automated keyword bid management, it can manage hundreds of accounts and make millions of bids changes each day - if needed.

It's a massive time saver, and that's no understatement.

It was created because 'smart bidding' such as tCPA doesn’t work for every campaign or account. If you’re getting less than 1-2 conversions a day per campaign,  target CPA and target ROAS just seem to struggle. They’re data hungry.

So we created - and have been using for over a year - our own bid manager.

We have an existing client who has in house PPC. 

The issue is the PPC campaign conversions are being attributed to direct traffic. They asked me to take a look, but I'm not familiar with the client nor their website set up. While my GA is pretty decent I rarely check anything to do with PPC campaigns, other than keyword reports.

The client uses Paypal for all payments, and we can't install a direct payment option. I am assuming that somehwhere in the users journey the session sdata is being stripped out and the return path after a successful conversion is being treated as direct. 

My first check was to see if the referral exclusion filter was in place, it was. But it is not keeping session data alive.

I thought this was the error causing the drop of session data so I had the dev fix the HTTP page to HTTPS so all of the connecting pages are HTTPS, when I checked conversions this morning they were still direct attributed.

So, I have a client that sells protein products online in the UK.

The reason given for the Remarketing disapprovals is 'Automatic item disapprovals due to policy violation' - so it doesn't actually tell me what the issue is, but I'm guessing it might be seeing these products as medical products? Has anyone experienced this before, or have any ideas on how to get more products approved?

Thanks in advance!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

1. Growing a group to 1 million members in 3 months

1. Target the right audience
2. Do your market research
3. Analyse your business demography
4. Educate yourself about Facebook keywords like engagement, likes, comments.......

I run an ecommerce business on Shopify. I have been using Google Adwords for over 2 years and had a great max CPA campaign getting me conversions for £6 per result. 

Last month I noticed Google Adwords was not showing the same conversions as what Google Analytics was showing, so I decided to add to the tracking code to make it count orders with different order numbers (I am unsure if this is where the problem started but it was on the same day). I then went on holiday for a couple weeks and forgot to check how my Google Adwords was going.

I have noticed a pretty big drop in sales, I usually get at least 100 per day and now I am getting around 60. At first I thought it was due to me being on holiday and not putting as much effort into PPC, but now I have realised its coz my Google Adwords tracking has stopped working, and Google stopped spending any of my money as I was not making the £6 CPA I was asking for. 

I have now got the conversion tracking working again, my question is - will I need to start CPC campaign or will my CPA campaign work again?

I'm having a tremendously difficult time explaining how to set up parameters within a Standard Event, particularly the Search event below.

&lt;script&gt;

fbq('track', 'Search', {

**search\_string: 'running shoes',**

content\_ids: \['1234abc', '5678def', '9012ghi'\],

content\_type: 'product',

value: 0.00,

currency: 'EUR'

});

&lt;/script&gt;

I understand that there's a way of setting specific parameters inside of an Event and there's certain Events that can only pass certain parameters. But what's confusing is how these parameters, say, map to a Product Catalog for dynamic remarketing? Or if you're not using them for dynamic remarketing, is there any value to including them at all? 

Moreover, every example seems to have some kind of dummy string inside of it. I think I get that some parameters require a string but, for example, search\_string, does that require a hard-coded string inside of it? Or is there something that needs to be done to make it so it's dynamic and reads out whatever a user searched in, what I guess is, a Search box that the FB Pixel understands is on the site in some capacity.

I feel like I've exhausted every resource I can find on this and still feel wildly confused about the whole thing and Facebook Support isn't helpful at all here as well.

Any insight into this specific facet of the Pixel would be greatly appreciated.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

\- Polish is not a supported language in Bing Ads.

\- You can actually use location targeting to target Poland.

\- Due to how Bing targets users, using the default 'English' language targeting in combination with location targeting for Poland, would mean that users would only see the ad if they are browsing with English language settings whilst in Poland.

Can I get some sort of feedback/confirmation that I am understanding this correctly before relaying this information back to the client? Alternatively, is there a reliable workaround to this?

I think this seems to be more of a general basic PPC strategy 



My friend knows that I am into PPC and asked me to help him advertise his ecommerce store online (F &amp; B related).

However my experience and knowledge is limited with regards to ecommerce, but I am thinking that with AdWords and Facebook, there are some tried and tested PROVEN methods to increase transactions and sales. 

Do let me know if my proposed general strategy makes sense and if any improvements can be made. 

**AdWords**


-Search Campaigns (targeting product related keywords)


-Display Campaigns (for branding and awareness)


-Shopping Campaigns (merchant centre) 


-Remarketing Campaigns (display network)


-Dynamic Remarketing Campaigns (from google shopping campaign)


- Dynamic search ads? (not really a big fan)


-Youtube Video Campaigns (product features)


- Responsive search ads (beta)



**Facebook**


-Traffic + Conversion campaigns (video, single image, carousel) 


-Dynamic product ads


-General retargeting ads


-Lookalike audiences of current customers








Anything that i missed out?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edited&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend knows that I am into PPC and asked me to help him advertise his ecommerce store online (F &amp;amp; B related).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However my experience and knowledge is limited with regards to ecommerce, but I am thinking that with AdWords and Facebook, there are some tried and tested PROVEN methods to increase transactions and sales. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do let me know if my proposed general strategy makes sense and if any improvements can be made. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AdWords&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Search Campaigns (targeting product related keywords)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Display Campaigns (for branding and awareness)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Shopping Campaigns (merchant centre) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Remarketing Campaigns (display network)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Dynamic Remarketing Campaigns (from google shopping campaign)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dynamic search ads? (not really a big fan)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Youtube Video Campaigns (product features)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Responsive search ads (beta)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Traffic + Conversion campaigns (video, single image, carousel) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Dynamic product ads&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-General retargeting ads&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Lookalike audiences of current customers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anything that i missed out?&lt;/p&gt;

FYI - I am based in the UK

I own a small business &amp; have a relationship with an ad agency for running an AdWords campaign. 

I recently contacted the person I deal with to ask to suspend their services for a period of time. In my request I asked for the agency to leave my campaign live but to stop maintaining it until further notice. 

This was all okay etc. However they are refusing to leave the campaign live as ‘they built the campaign and it is therefore their intellectual property so they would be responsible if anything went wrong’. 

This has seriously soured what has to date been quite a good relationship between us from my perspective. Before I respond to them, I want to get an idea of where exactly I stand legally etc. here. If they do not revise their stance, I would honestly not continue the relationship into the future as I would consider this to be them acting in very bad faith. 

I could be going way overkill with the above but want to know what the situation actually is before I contact them about this to ask them to reconsider just in case they start being obstructive. 

To be clear: I know AdWords campaigns should be monitored at all times etc. Please do not comment on this aspect of things - the timescales involved are relatively short. 

Some maybe helpful information:

Agency created the account using a new gmail email address. 

My company’s payment details are linked to the account - the agency is ONLY paid for their services - AdWords spend goes straight from us to Google via debit card. To be clear - the agency DO NOT pay google anything in any way, shape or form. 

No formal or informal (to my memory) terms and conditions have been agreed between us and them that would cover this scenario.

And since geography is very important I want to show the geographical area in my ads. I also have different products so I want to show different ads based on the product. This is how I done it: 

Everything in the same campaign: 

Adgroup - General - Buy widget X

Adgroup - General - Buy widget Y  


Adgroup - General - Buy widget Z  


Adgroup - Stockholm - Buy widget X  


Adgroup - Stockholm - Buy widget Y  


Adgroup - Stockholm - Buy widget Z

Adgroup - Malmö - Buy widget X  


Adgroup - Malmö - Buy widget Y  


Adgroup - Malmö - Buy widget Z  


and so on for the top 20 biggest cities

Then in each adgroup I will use modified broad matches. So in Stockholm I would have: 

\+Buy +widgetX +stockholm

\+shop +widgetX +stockholm

and so on

But I would also have for different parts of Stockholm:

\+Buy +widgetX +östermalm  


\+shop +widgetX +östermalm  


Then I would make negative keywords for all geographical locations and put in adgroups:

Adgroup - General - Buy widget X

Adgroup - General - Buy widget Y

Adgroup - General - Buy widget Z

So that if I search:

""buy widgetX östermalm"" I would be served an from Adgroup - Stockholm - Buy widget X but if I search ""buy widgetX"" or ""Buy widgetZ kiruna"" (a city that does not have its own adgroup) I would be served a more general ad from Adgroup - General - Buy widget X.

This way I can sculpt the traffic to the most relevant ads and everything that doesnt have its own adgroup will go to the general location adgroup that is the same for the whole country.

 I guess the problem will be that I will have over 200 000 different keywords just from the start only to cover the top 20 biggest cities.

\*Update I solved the ads not showing issue. Apparently I had to click on settings on the upper right hand side of my page, click on General, Page Visibility. Now these settings have to be adjusted when looking at your page not when you login to your page. I clicked on Publish and now my ads are running.

It said my reach eas about 400,000 people now it&amp;#39;s only 1,000 and my ad views slowed down a lot. I did research and theirs literally groups with hundreds of thousands of people with my niche. My categories are Forex signals, Forex trading. I had it set to Facebook only for the traffic and disabled Instagram and there partner networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any suggestions on what I can do to reach more people, also why did my reach drop so much from 400,000 to 1000 in just a few hours? I only got like 200 ad views in this short period of time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Update Facebook unpublished my page and gave me no reason. That&amp;#39;s why the timeline ads wont show. Theirs no way to know why it was unpublished and theirs no way for me to contact support. Also the appeals link I found on some help articles anymore. What am I supposed to do now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Update I solved the ads not showing issue. Apparently I had to click on settings on the upper right hand side of my page, click on General, Page Visibility. Now these settings have to be adjusted when looking at your page not when you login to your page. I clicked on Publish and now my ads are running.

P.S. The reason I'm using an event for page load is because you can't optimise for a conversion 'page view' in facebook.

I suppose you can just run a 'traffic' campaign and optimise for pageview that way... which is the same thing as above right?

&lt;p&gt;Basically what I&amp;#39;m asking is there a difference between pixel events in how they&amp;#39;re treated by facebook&amp;#39;s algorithm other than their name?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. The reason I&amp;#39;m using an event for page load is because you can&amp;#39;t optimise for a conversion &amp;#39;page view&amp;#39; in facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BUT &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose you can just run a &amp;#39;traffic&amp;#39; campaign and optimise for pageview that way... which is the same thing as above right?&lt;/p&gt;

I'm a little fed up with PPC and trying to get things right. I've had my small business for around 8 months, and had dabbled with PPC overtime. Now I realise the urgency and necessity - if I don't get people to my site I don't make money. 

I like to think that I have picked up Google AdWords rather well, and now understand everything which I think is relevant to my business. I haven't seen great results, but I'm confident that eventually the visitors will convert (I sell relatively high ticket items) and haven't spent too much. 

I am extremely frustrated with Facebook Ads to the point where I feel like giving up on PPC (and in turn, my business) altogether. A few months ago, I spent £30 and got 200 link clicks, and 1 or 2 sales, the CPC was around £0.15 - great i thought. I tried it again...cost was around £0.35 per click - over double. 

Today, I tried some new Ads. I initially researched and selected my goal as conversation. I spent around £5 while noticing that this didn't bring me one visitor. Having spoken to Facebook, I then found out that I didn't have enough data for this option, so essentially wasted spend. I then tried Visits to site. I have had 6 clicks, at a cost of £1.20 each click. I don't understand why I am looking at 4x my original cost.

My question is, for all the (perceived) advantages of Facebook, should I purely concentrate on AdWords and totally give up on trying (and failing/getting frustrated) with Facebook Ads?

Cheers all!

I just wanted to ask if there is some 'quarantine' or some period after starting a new search campaign/account?

I am at day 4 now and these are pretty low search volume keywords I have, but I was getting 10-20 clicks per day (as expected) during day 1 and 2. Now my impressions have dropped quite dramatically lately and I got only 3 clicks last night (60% impressions lost due to Ad Rank).

Now my question is, when should I start worrying about QS? I already got QS assigned to some of my keywords and it doesn't really make sense too much to me yet. Some keywords with 0 clicks got 7 or 8, and some KWs got a miserable 2 or 3... One keyword got 17 impressions, 1 click, which is reasonable CTR I guess, but still has below average expected CTR and a QS of 2...

Is there some kind of timeframe how much I should wait before getting worried and before my campaign picks up?

I'm about to kick off my journey freelancing for local biz. clients (using FB &amp; Insta ads for lead gen.). Before I dive in, there is one thing I need clarity on.

My question is, how long do you keep a client for? I'm sure the general answer will be ""as long as possible / until the money stops coming in"" but what I'm really trying to get at is:

Say I get a pet food store as a client, I run ads for a 20% off pet food coupon to generate leads.... but this can only go on for so long right?? At some point, it's going to reach every possible pet owner in the nearby area (assuming I exclude people that already signed up for the coupon.)

I guess I can speak with the owner to advertise local events that they may run like a ""dog play day"" or something.

My understanding is that I am here to get them more customers, consistently. Would this specific example of a client contract only be possible for 1 or 2 months then before I become irrelevant?

I've recently come on board at a company that has had a half-dozen different people in the adwords account, and the number of different overlapping philosophies and settings is staggering.

1)Different tracking templates applied at different levels with different variable names, some of which are obviously copied and pasted from some agencies other clients and expects us to capture parameters we don't have.  

2)An insane number of ad extensions applied at different levels, often with just terrible language..

3)a wide variety of targeting and bid adjustments on random levels etc

I cut all the fat and fixed a few things, which brought our ROAS from 105% to 185% in my first week, but there's a fluctuation that appears to me to be more than average, and I believe it's probably because a few agencies imported negative kys and possibly scripts, and all sorts of things that are hurting our performance. Any ideas how to do a complete audit, not just of ky/ad/etc, but of all the various obscure functions of adwords? I don't know if there are external scripts running, for example.

I hate asking noob questions, but I have given out a lot of tips over the years in the SEO subreddits so I don't feel too bad asking for help! Just to set some context, I have a lot of SEO experience, but always left PPC to the PPC guys. Now I have my own mini-agency I would be a fool not to start to get to grips with it, even if I end up getting some proper help with it once I can afford to.

For now, I am sailing down noob river.

A site I am working with sells industrial products, a decent chunk of which have a high price/good margin.

There are some searches for the individual products and categories, but not a huge amount - and I am not coming close to spending the budget.

I've been pondering how to best structure Display campaigns and thought I'd ask here to get some more ideas.

Right now I've done it so that any sort of remarketing (any previous interaction with the site) is in one campaign with multiple audiences and an ad set in it's own ad group. So an example would be:

Campaign: Remarketing Campaign 2018

Ad Group 1: May Offer - The audience would be ""All Users"" and ""All Converters"" with their own adjusted bid

Ad Group 2: June Offer - Same audience as above

Ad Group 3: July Offer - Same audience as above

etc.

There would be only 1 ad group running at any particular time.

But when it comes to expanding out that to try acquire new customers I'm not 100% sure if the same sort of structure is correct. How I've done it before is something like this:

Campaign: Expand Targeting

Ad Group 1: Keywords + Topics

Ad Group 2: Similar To All Users

Ad Group 3: Custom Intent

Ad Group 4: Affinity + Keywords + Similar Audiences

etc.

Where all ad groups are running at the same time with the same ads but only 1 targeting method per ad group.

Does the above structure look alright? The reason why they are grouped up into 1 campaign is so that the Google system can eventually favour the best performing ad group/audience like the remarketing but I do also fear it might just favour the one with the highest click rate and not conversions.

Also if I were to put all targeting methods into 1 campaign that would allow me to generate enough conversion data to eventually use an automated bidding strategy, which is what I've done for remarketing campaigns.

Any help or personal insight would be greatly appreciated as I can't find a lot of literature on this online. Thanks.

&lt;p&gt;etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There would be only 1 ad group running at any particular time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to expanding out that to try acquire new customers I&amp;#39;m not 100% sure if the same sort of structure is correct. How I&amp;#39;ve done it before is something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Campaign: Expand Targeting&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ad Group 1: Keywords + Topics&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ad Group 2: Similar To All Users&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ad Group 3: Custom Intent&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ad Group 4: Affinity + Keywords + Similar Audiences&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where all ad groups are running at the same time with the same ads but only 1 targeting method per ad group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does the above structure look alright? The reason why they are grouped up into 1 campaign is so that the Google system can eventually favour the best performing ad group/audience like the remarketing but I do also fear it might just favour the one with the highest click rate and not conversions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also if I were to put all targeting methods into 1 campaign that would allow me to generate enough conversion data to eventually use an automated bidding strategy, which is what I&amp;#39;ve done for remarketing campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any help or personal insight would be greatly appreciated as I can&amp;#39;t find a lot of literature on this online. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

In my opinion, asking these questions doesn't create quality, it merely qualifies better; and because it better qualifies it has a higher abandon rate ( and thus higher CPL).

So we're adding all of these fields that are required to make a quote, but we're not actually providing one instantly.  The lead ultimately has to speak to an agent anyway!

I've done sales and I wouldn't last if that was my close rate from warm leads.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm having problems trying to use the conversion campaign when switching from ViewContent to AddToCart. 

&amp;nbsp;


Here are our events from last week in numbers (from our webpage):
ViewContent 5k
AddToCart 103
Initiate Checkout 68
Purchase 5

&amp;nbsp;

**BACKGROUND INFO**
We are a Small Boutique Brand with our own products (designed and produced) - advertising Interior Design products from linen/cotton bedding for babies to adults (price range 15€ to 200€) to wooden toys for kids (price range 30€ to 270€) selling worldwide.

&amp;nbsp;

**FB SETUP**
As we don't have enough Purchase events for our data set, I set up ViewContent as an Ad Set goal. I ran the set 3-4 days and it was having 30+ events (ViewContent) per day. The set has 2 ads, one image ad (with canvas for mobile) with the score of 9; the other is a slider (with canvas for mobile) with the score of 7. The budget was set to 5€ per day. During these 3-4 days there were 3 AddToCart Events and 2 Purchases.

&amp;nbsp;

**ADDITIONAL QUESTION**
Both ads in the Ad Set above are showing the same category (toys) of products (our best sellers, basically). The rest of the product categories I'll add into this Ad Set once I can make these ones work. Here I would like to know if it is better to mix ads for different products (in different categories) in the same ad set or to separate them by campaigns and run them at different times for the same audience or for different audiences?

&amp;nbsp;

**AUDIENCE**
This Ad Set is targeting our warm audience – Instagram engaged (90 days) and website visitors with more than 2 visits (excluding AddToCart and Purchase) in countries where most of our customers come from (parts of west EU, USA, Canada, AU and Japan) – the audience should be around 50-60k in size. Most of the audience comes from Instagram, where we have 94k followers. 

&amp;nbsp;

**TRYING TO SCALE**
I then changed the budget to 6€ and that put the ad set to learning mode ... so I changed the conversion event as well and set it to AddToCart. 30h later, I have 15 ViewContent and no AddToCart.

&amp;nbsp;

**QUESTION**
Is it time to switch back to ViewContent? … am I missing something? I had AddToCart and Purchase conversion goals set up earlier and never had real success – maybe I stopped it too early, I don't know anymore – how long do you let Conversion Campaigns last if they do not bring enough Events?

&amp;nbsp;

**ADDITIONAL QUESTION**
In addition, I used to target Hot Audience - people who added products to cart - with more “generic brand ads” that had a huge frequency (above 20) and produced just a couple of conversions per month (mostly view through purchases and not click). Now I've switched to Dynamic re-marketing and I do see some AddToCart, even Initiate Checkout, but I'm 3 weeks in and still no conversion. 

&amp;nbsp;

We don't offer any special incentive to get them back, though, and ads in general are more descriptive and not sales oriented (brand strategy). Our biggest emphasis is on really good looking lifestyle photos of products – since everything is catering to the design aspect.

All these English-speaking countries perform about on par with each other.

We recently took the next step and localized our site content to some non-English speaking languages, like German, Spanish, and French.  We had our keywords and ad text from our Adwords campaigns translated by professional translators.  We launched these campaigns with some expectations that our CPAs would be in range with what we're seeing now, and unfortunately that hasn't been the case.

Our ad CTRs are very similar to their US counterparts, but we're seeing much lower CPCs and super low conversion rates, which makes me think we're not getting the same quality of traffic from these campaigns that we are from our ones in the US.

Looking for anyone that has advice or has tackled this kind of thing before?  Managing campaigns in languages I don't speak has been interesting to say the least...

Running a physical product ads in FB.

Click through is great -- engagement on landing page looks really good-- people are clicking through to products, adding a variety of products to cart  -- engagement on post shows a lot of interest too.

Only issue is, my add to cart metric is really out of wack. By no means am I trying to blame the issues on anything external, I understand this could have everything to do with the product/price/trustworthiness etc.

Right now about 2.5% of people that clicked the add to cart button have physically clicked to the next 'reached checkout' portion. 

What could be causing people to add to cart with no intention of moving forward at that high of a rate? Could it be quality of traffic?

Using a Lookalike audience (view content) from an earlier run at the same product.

&lt;p&gt;Purchases/Sales: 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m selling high ticket items, the average price is 800€ (but my profit margin is only 140€ on each product) but I&amp;#39;ve setup classified ads so all people knew I was an high ticket item store when they clicked my ads. I&amp;#39;m targeting long tail keyword with apparently good intent. Would you keep pushing this campaign? Because I watched the course on Udemy by Isaac Rudansky (watched all the lessons without skipping one) and I remember he said I should start worrying about my campaign after I get 100-250 clicks and 1000-1500  impressions... So now that I reach these number I&amp;#39;m worried... Should I be less strict because I&amp;#39;m an high ticket item store?&lt;/p&gt;

* 110k impressions
* 2.85k clicks
* 2.03&amp;#37; conversion rate (58 installs)

Also I couldn't find, how can I set the campaign, so it shows ads only on Google Play Store. Or how to target only mobile devices, not tablets. Is it possible?

1. can Adwords UAC be profitable for casual arcade game?
2. How to determine optimal TCPA?
3. what are good values of CTR, conversion rate, cost per conversion (install)?

&lt;p&gt;Also I couldn&amp;#39;t find, how can I set the campaign, so it shows ads only on Google Play Store. Or how to target only mobile devices, not tablets. Is it possible?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry, a lot of questions, I&amp;#39;ll try to summarize:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can Adwords UAC be profitable for casual arcade game?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to determine optimal TCPA?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what are good values of CTR, conversion rate, cost per conversion (install)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to focus on Play Store ads only, and only on mobiles?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there better alternatives to Adwords UAC? I&amp;#39;ve tried Facebook Ads, but with no visual result.&lt;/li&gt;

She was a new agency client for just 2 days.

What most people don't realize is that there are actually 5 types of clients.

And they are NOT all created equal... far from it actually.

And the funnels that attract them all are uniquely different.

If you are an agency owner, coach, consultant, or expert, you might want to pay attention.

The moral of the story: Which types of clients are YOU attracting?

Are you attracting the highest value, easiest to work with clients? Or are you going after pain in the ass high maintenance low results clients?

Because to experience massive success, WHO you attract matters a great deal.

Here are the 5 types of clients.

Low paying clients

Will drive you crazy. Ask the world and willing to pay for none of it. When it doesn’t work, they will blame you. Unwilling to spend. High maintenance. If you are attached to the results, most of them will not succeed and you will feel guilty. High refund rates. Jump from shiny object to shiny object.

Recurring payment clients

At Traffic And Conversion, Ryan Deiss told a great story about how he got recurring clients in the Forex niche. He gave his affiliates 100&amp;#37; of the commission for a front end sale. The catch? He gave those customers a free one month trial of his private recurring membership site. Why? Because recurring clients are better than single sale clients.

High paying clients

Easy going. Ask for very little and do so humbly. Accept responsibility for their own results. Will succeed with or without you. Your goal is to guide them there faster, better, and with less mistakes.

Recurring high paying clients

Results matter the most. The faster and more consistently you can deliver exceptional results, the longer you will keep them.

Lifetime recurring high paying clients

Feel more like friends with money. You will have personal relationships and business relationships blended together. They will work with you for life, more based on who you are. There is no magic formula to get them, though this helps. Treat all your clients like they fall in this category from the very start. Some of them will. Jay Abraham calls this ""the strategy of preeminence"". Be their ""most trusted adviser for life"".

Here's the moral of the story. You need a lot less better clients to experience massive success.

Here's the kicker. The bulk of the competition is at the low end of the spectrum.

May the force be with you.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Had a friend who got threatened with a lawsuit if he didn&amp;#39;t give a client a refund by Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

How do you guys manage expectations of your clients? Do you have any that are too close? 

Here goes... *deep breath*

I have five years experience working agency side in what feels like every niche of digital marketing. Sort of. Mostly I've been in SEO but I've done lots of PPC management, content marketing, outreach, bits of PR etc etc. I went in-house last year at a start up who were releasing some business software. 

The directors are SO close to it, and despite admitting they have little to no idea about digital marketing and zero experience, refuse to listen to the plans and ideas of the three digital marketing execs they hired. 

There's a LOT more to this story prior to now but where we are today is: we have launched a PPC campaign looking for conversions to get people to sign up to a free trial of our software. We are currently four days in and every aspect of our PPC data is being excruciatingly analysed by the dirs, changes are being made to bids, ads and budgets all the time. We are NOT getting the conversions. 

I cannot get them to wait until we have more data before we make these sweeping changes and declarations of defeat. I can't get them to understand that it needs time and activity to become a legitimate prospect for Google (brand new site, domain, Adwords account, campaigns etc.)

To the extent that I'm questioning myself. We are getting good impressions (enormous impression share) and click through. We have strong negative keyword list and our ads are relevant and well worded. So SHOULD it be performing better by now? Am I going mad?

Landing page needs improving but I'm locked out of editing capabilities on that front so. Same goes for user journey to the free sign up. Though it does appear to be solid for me. 

Anyway. This was more of a rant about work - but the question stands; do you have any clients or bosses that you feel are too close to the nitty gritty details of their Adwords/PPC accounts that stops you from being able to properly manage it?

*To be able to have keywords bid automatically adjust to the ""Top of Page"" bid if in\-between a certain price range. If it is under that ""Top Of Page"" bid then it would adjust to the ""First Page Bid"" estimated by Google given a specific price range.

But as you know, usually an ecommerce store has the conversion rate around 1&amp;#37;. This mean on average I'm going to get 1 sale every 100 people that visit my store.

On Google Keyword planner I choose keywords where the max cost per click was 0.4$. With a 200$ of daily budget, this mean= 200/0.4=500 clicks every day, so as I said previously If I have a traditional 1&amp;#37; of conversion on my store I should have 5 sales every day. 150\*5=750$ of profit every day.

First time PPC poster here, I'm glad to be part of such an awesome community. 

I'm running a campaign for a productized service, there is a multi-step lead capture form and the final page is pricing with 'buy now' buttons. 

Because of this structure there are 3 distinct conversions. Contact Info submission, project info submission and an actual transaction. 

is there a way to set up individual columns for each conversion and obtain cost per step data? Is this only possible by importing google analytics data to a custom adwords report? Or is there another way?

This is an example of how I would like to structure the columns for each conversion type:

Number of Conversions | Conversion Rate | Cost Per Conversion 

I think this would be useful to analyze the cost effectiveness of the ads, targeting and keywords in relation to the number of conversions.

&lt;p&gt;However I noticed this has no effect. If I search for &amp;quot;orange widget&amp;quot; my product ad shows but it uses the same product image not the row with the color &amp;quot;orange&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does it not work like that? I noticed products are showing from competition have orange in the title, so &amp;quot;orange widget&amp;quot; should I also be adding the color to the title? &lt;/p&gt;

TL;DR: setting a 'find and replace' rule for the gtin attribute on Merchant Center feeds leads to the products getting flagged for disapproval, despite the new gtin being a valid value.

I've run into a problem with our e-comm client. They use an app called ""Adwords Robot"" to automatically create a feed for Merchant Center and by extension Adwords Shopping. 

Now, I've been getting tossed a yellow flag that I'm using restricted GTINs; which upon further inspection, is true. There are over 300 products whose GTINs start with 2. So, I face the problem of having to wipe out that leading 2 for all 300 of these products. 

I figured I have two solutions. Download the .txt file that the Adwords robot creates and do a 'find and replace'. This wouldn't work because the file gets refreshed every day. The other one is creating a rule for the Feed in Merchant Center to 'find and replace' the leading 2 and leaving the remaining numbers to give me the 12-value GTIN. But, I tried this method and it led to something weird. The 'find and replace' was able to remove the leading 2 and create a valid GTIN value, but the test said those products would be disapproved. 

Has anyone had experience with this problem? Or does anyone have any input on what I may be doing wrong with my approach?
